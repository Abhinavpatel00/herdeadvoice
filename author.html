                    Abhinav is someone who loves to deep dive into everything that he loves. He loves to explore things at his best. He loves to learn, he loves to invent, sometimes he thinks that he can change the world. He can stop cruelty to every innocent being but maybe that's only his dream that can't be true. He loves to give a message of kindness, mercy, compassion, and justice, which is why he himself is a vegan. He tries his best to reduce suffering, and that's why he chose to become vegan. He is always on the lookout for new ideas and ways to improve the world around him. He is so empathetic that he cannot bring himself to harm even a mosquito because he believes every innocent being has a right to live freely and happily.

                    Abhinav says, "The pain I felt while writing this book was so much sometimes I lost my smile for many days because the pain I wrote in my writings was tremendous and I can't write the pain without going to my imaginary world of darkness where I can feel the pain of someone who has been in that darkness forever. Writing this book has changed my heart so much. Throughout the process, I found myself deeply immersed in the world where I felt the weight of pain and suffering. At times, the enormity of their experiences weighed heavily on me, causing me to withdraw and reflect. Yet, I remained committed to the importance of shining a light on this critical issue and continued to write from a place of empathy and understanding.
                    <br><br>
                    The emotions that stirred within me while writing this book were intense and profound. I was forced to confront the depth of human suffering and the unrelenting pain that some endure every day. There were moments when the tears flowed freely down my cheeks as I wrote about the struggles and hardships that my characters faced.
                    <br><br>
                    As I delved deeper into the darkness, I found that it became harder and harder to escape its clutches. The pain that I wrote about seeped into my soul, leaving me feeling raw and vulnerable. It was a struggle to find balance and to keep my own emotions in check. Despite the toll that it took on me, I persevered. I knew that my writing had the power to make a difference and to shed light on the issues that I felt so deeply about. And so, I wrote with all my heart and soul, pouring my emotions onto the page.
                    <br><br>
                    The agony that consumed me while writing this book was unbearable at times. I was plunged into a dark abyss, where the weight of the pain and suffering that my characters endured threatened to crush me under its heavy burden. The more I wrote, the more the anguish consumed me. I was living and breathing the heartache and misery of those I was writing about, and it was tearing me apart from the inside out. The tears that streamed down my face as I penned their stories were a testament to the emotional toll that this book was taking on me. There were moments when I felt like I couldn't go on when the pain was too much to bear. But I knew that I had to keep writing. I had to give a voice to those who had been silenced for far too long, and I had to shine a light on the atrocities that were being committed every day.
                    <br><br>
                    As I delved deeper into the darkness, I found myself becoming lost in the pain and despair. It was like a never-ending nightmare, where the suffering never ceased, and the hopelessness seemed insurmountable. But I refused to give up. I refused to let their stories go untold. And so, I wrote with every fiber of my being, pouring my heart and soul onto the page. The words that flowed from my pen were infused with the raw and unbridled emotions that I was feeling, and they cut to the very core of my being.
                    <br><br>
                    If writing this book has caused me this much pain, then what about those whom I am talking about in the book? Please, do change for them and stop this cycle of abuse from happening. Change yourself and your surroundings. Fight for justice, fight for mercy, fight for compassion, and change the way you think about consent and relationships. Please be part of my mission to create a safer society for our upcoming generation. Distribute this book as much as you can.
                    <br><br>
                    Writing this book changed me in ways that I never could have imagined. It broke me down and forced me to confront the depths of human suffering. It opened my eyes. It taught me to be more empathetic and compassionate towards others and to always strive to understand their experiences."
