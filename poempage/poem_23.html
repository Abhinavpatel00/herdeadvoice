<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Why blame the girls for what they bear,</p>
<p>For crimes against them, so unfair?<br />
Why shift the blame to those in pain,<br />
And punish them again and again?<br />
Why force them to hide and stay,<br />
When justice should pave the way?</p>
<p>Why victim blame when we should see,<br />
The root of the problem in society?</p>
<p>Why ask what she was wearing or doing,<br />
When the real issue is power and thinking?<br />
Why make her feel guilty and shamed,<br />
When the perpetrator should be blamed?</p>
<p>Why do we teach our daughters to fear,<br />
Instead of teaching our sons to hear,<br />
Their no's, their boundaries, their rights,<br />
And respect them without any fights?<br />
Why do we make the victim suffer,<br />
When it's the rapist who deserves the buffer?</p>
<p>Why blame the girls for what they bear,<br />
When they're the ones who are truly rare,</p>
<p>Strong and brave to face the world,<br />
Despite the stigma and insults hurled?<br />
Let's change our perspective and start,<br />
To support and uplift every broken heart.</p>
