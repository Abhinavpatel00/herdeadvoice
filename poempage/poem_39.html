            <h1>A Call For The World Beyond The External</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Oh kind maidens, hear my plea;<br />
Your heart and eyes to see;<br />
That physical beauty is not all;<br />
In a potential mate, big or small.</p>
<p>Do not let your heart be swayed;<br />
By appearances, do not be played.<br />
For a man may be unfit in shape;<br />
But his character is beyond escape.</p>
<p>Likewise, a woman may be fair;<br />
But her nature could lead to despair,<br />
So do not judge by an outward view,<br />
Look beyond, to see what is true.</p>
<p>If you choose by looks alone;<br />
You may be missing out on one,<br />
Whose heart is full of love and care;<br />
But their confidence, you may tear.</p>
<p>You may be lowering their morale;<br />
And causing them much inner turmoil,<br />
They too, seek love and affection;<br />
But being judged by mere perception.</p>
<p>So I implore you, do not kill;<br />
The spirit of those who strive to fill;<br />
Your life with kindness, mercy, justice,<br />
And fight for you, despite the fuss.</p>
<p>Do not let physical appearance blind;<br />
The true essence are those who are kind,<br />
It is their heart that truly matters;<br />
Their beauty, a mere fleeting flatter.</p>
<p>So kind maidens, hear my call;<br />
And look beyond the physical wall;<br />
In the heart lies the true worth ;<br />
Of a potential mate, on this earth.</p>
<p>Oh dear girls &amp; boys do not judge by mere appearance,<br />
It is just a fleeting and shallow occurrence,<br />
Physical beauty may attract at first sight,<br />
But it is not what makes a person truly right.</p>
<p>Do not be blinded by just a pretty face;<br />
For it may hide a heart of utter disgrace.<br />
He may be fit and muscular, no doubt;<br />
But his character might be full of flaws and drought.</p>
<p>A she may be stunning, but beware;<br />
For her nature might be rotten, so unfair,<br />
Judging them based on looks is a curse,<br />
That can lead to disaster and things much worse.</p>
<p>Do not let the lust of your eyes guide your heart;<br />
For it is a path that can tear you apart,<br />
See beyond the physical and look within;<br />
For that is where true beauty begins.</p>
<p>Kindness, mercy, justice, and love;<br />
Are attributes that come from above,<br />
A heart that holds such treasures within;<br />
Is a heart that shines bright with no deceitful spin.<br />
And she will find the love and mate that's true,<br />
That she truly deserve and a life that's anew</p>
<p>Do not let society's standards dictate;<br />
For they are often just a mere fake,<br />
A person's worth is not in their looks;<br />
But in their soul and how it cooks.</p>
<p>A judge based on mere appearance,<br />
may lead to complete dissonance ;<br />
To show you what true love and care can be,<br />
And that is something that should be cherished and set free.</p>
<p>So, dear girls &amp; boys do not be swayed by looks,<br />
For they are nothing but superficial hooks,<br />
Embrace the beauty of a pure heart,<br />
That is where love and hope will start.</p>
<p>This world full of darkness and despair,<br />
We need to stand tall and show we care,<br />
Love and kindness are our only light;<br />
That can guide us through the darkest night.</p>
<p>So, do not let your judgement be blurred,<br />
By society's norms and ideals absurd,<br />
See beyond the physical, and look within;<br />
For that is where true beauty begins.</p>
<p>The world is full of deception and lies,<br />
And often we are fooled by what we see,<br />
But true beauty is in the soul and mind,<br />
And that is what makes a person truly free.</p>
<p>Do not be swayed by the superficial,<br />
For it is a trap that leads to sorrow,<br />
And the one who judges by looks alone;<br />
Will soon find themselves in a world so hollow.</p>
<p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder;<br />
And true beauty cannot be confined,<br />
For it radiates from deep within;<br />
And it's a beauty of a different kind.</p>
<p>The true value of a person lies not;<br />
In their body, but in their soul and mind,<br />
For that is what makes a person whole;<br />
And it's something that cannot be confined.</p>
<p>It's not the looks, but the personality;<br />
That should be the basis of your choice,<br />
For in the end, it's the heart that all matters,<br />
And it's the soul that gives the voice.</p>
<p>Do not let the world's shallow ways;<br />
Dictate how you choose a partner or a friend,<br />
For true beauty is not found on the surface;<br />
But in the heart, where love and compassion blend.</p>
<p>If we choose someone based on looks,<br />
We are missing out on so much more,<br />
For a person's worth lies in their heart,<br />
And that's what you should be looking for.</p>
<p>It's the soul that matters in this world,<br />
And the heart that beats within,<br />
For that is where the true beauty lies,<br />
And there true love and joy begin.</p>
<p>If you seek a partner or a friend,<br />
Look for kindness, honesty, and grace,<br />
Those are the traits that truly matters,<br />
And they are the ones that will never fade.</p>
<p>Do not judge a person by their appearance,<br />
But by the depth of their heart and soul,<br />
For that is where the true beauty lies;<br />
And that is what makes a person whole.</p>
<p>Remember, my dear young friend;<br />
That looks are not all that they seem,<br />
And it's the heart and soul that truly matter;<br />
And that's what makes a person a dream and will bring self esteem .</p>
<p>In matters of the heart, we often seek;<br />
The beauty of the face, the physique,<br />
But, Is this all that we should find?<br />
In the one that we want to call "mine".</p>
<p>For what lies within, beyond the skin<br />
Is what makes a person whole, within<br />
And though we may be drawn to looks<br />
We must seek out what's in the books</p>
<p>The kindness, compassion, empathy;<br />
These are the traits we need to see;<br />
In those we choose to love and trust,<br />
For these are the traits that truly must.</p>
<p>Guide us through the ups and downs;<br />
Of life's journey, with all its rounds;<br />
And if we choose our crushes based;<br />
On these good factors, we'll be graced.</p>
<p>With a love that's built on a solid base;<br />
And not on looks that time will erase,<br />
We'll find someone who truly cares;<br />
And who won't exploit us or bring us scares.</p>
<p>But if we choose to judge by face alone;<br />
We'll find ourselves in danger zones,<br />
Outer beauty fades away and with it goes;<br />
The love that we thought should always grow.</p>
<p>So let us look beyond the surface shine;<br />
And seek the qualities that truly define;<br />
A person's worth, and in doing so;<br />
We'll find the love that we'll love to know.</p>
<p>And in this way, we'll also see;<br />
How we can change society;<br />
By showing that looks are not enough;<br />
And that true love is built on stuff.</p>
<p>That comes from within, from the heart;<br />
And that's where love starts;<br />
So let us choose wisely, and let us see;<br />
That true love comes from being free.</p>
<p>From the shackles of looks and fame;<br />
And in doing so, we'll reclaim;<br />
Our power to choose with our hearts;<br />
And make a world where love imparts.</p>
<p>Kindness, compassion and the will,<br />
To fight against abuse and to fill;<br />
Our lives with love that's built to last,<br />
And not on looks that soon will pass.</p>
