            <h1>The Deals Of Soul</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>In a dark and desolate world,<br />
A girl's innocence was sold and hurled,<br />
Into a life of misery and pain,<br />
A life where she has no control or gain.</p>
<p>She was forced to sell her body,<br />
To satisfy the whims of those who were gaudy,<br />
Her tears went unnoticed and unheard,<br />
Her voice was silenced and blurred.</p>
<p>Forced into a life of shame,<br />
Her body used for others' gain.<br />
A victim of society's neglect,<br />
Her future now an uncertain prospect.</p>
<p>Her eyes once held a spark of hope,<br />
Now empty and devoid of scope.<br />
Her spirit broken, her will now weak,<br />
She carries on, day by day, week by week.</p>
<p>No one hears her silent cries,<br />
No one sees the pain in her eyes.<br />
Lost in a world of darkness and despair,<br />
She longs for someone to care.</p>
<p>But no one comes to her aid,<br />
As she continues to be betrayed.<br />
Sold and used like a commodity,<br />
Her life now a tragic anomaly.</p>
<p>She was treated like a mere object,<br />
Used and abused without any respect,<br />
Her dreams shattered, her hopes dimmed,<br />
Her body violated, her soul trimmed.</p>
<p>Her life was no longer her own,<br />
A victim of the vicious and the unknown,<br />
Her screams echoed in the night,<br />
As she fought against this vile plight.</p>
<p>But her cries fell on deaf ears,<br />
And her pain remained unseen and unclear.<br />
For in a world where lust rules all,<br />
A girl's worth is measured by how much she can enthrall.</p>
<p>So let us not turn a blind eye,<br />
To the pain of those who are forced to comply,<br />
Let us rise up and fight against this plight,<br />
And give these girls the chance to see the light.</p>
<p>For they deserve to be loved and cherished,<br />
Not bought and sold like some perishable merchandise,<br />
Let us stand with them and be their voice,<br />
And help them break free from this cruel choice.</p>
<p>For every girl forced into prostitution,<br />
We must show love and compassion.<br />
We must lift them up and offer a way,<br />
To a future full of hope and light of day.</p>
<p>In the depths of our souls, we find a truth,<br />
A truth that transcends our daily pursuit,<br />
A truth that speaks of love and unity,<br />
Of empathy, compassion, and community.</p>
<p>But in this world, so full of noise and distraction,<br />
We often forget this essential satisfaction,<br />
We chase after power, wealth, and fame,<br />
Ignoring the cost, neglecting the pain.</p>
<p>We live in a society that values success,<br />
But success at what cost? What do we address?<br />
Do we measure our worth by the money we earn,<br />
Or by the kindness we show, the lessons we learn?</p>
<p>It's time for us to awaken, to open our eyes,<br />
To see the world through a new set of ties,<br />
To embrace our humanity, our shared existence,<br />
And recognize that we all need assistance.</p>
<p>For in the end, it's not about what we gain,<br />
But about how we live, how we manage the strain,<br />
And if we can find it within ourselves to be kind,<br />
Then a better world we'll surely find.</p>
