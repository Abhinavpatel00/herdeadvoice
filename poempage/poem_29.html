            <h1>The End Of Time</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>She was pure, a delicate flower,<br />
Until they came, with such power.<br />
Ripped her soul, and left her bare,<br />
In a world, that didn't seem to care.</p>
<p>They took her innocence, with their lust,<br />
And left her feeling nothing but disgust.<br />
Her screams were silenced, by their force,<br />
As they showed her, what was their true source.</p>
<p>But after, when the damage was done,<br />
She was seen, as nothing but a used one.<br />
Blamed and shamed, for their own crime,<br />
Her life was shattered, in no time.</p>
<p>They said she asked for it, with her dress,<br />
As if that gave them the right, to express,<br />
Their animalistic nature, without a care,<br />
Leaving her to suffer, in despair.</p>
<p>But she was more than just a body,<br />
More than an object, for their hobby.<br />
She was a person, with dreams and goals,<br />
A being, with a beautiful soul.</p>
<p>Her voice deserves to be heard,<br />
Her pain should not be ignored.<br />
She deserves justice, and so much more,<br />
For the violence, that she had to endure.</p>
<p>It's time to change the narrative,<br />
To stop blaming and shaming the captive.<br />
To hold accountable, those who inflict,<br />
And to give the survivors, the love and respect.</p>
<p>Let's educate, and spread awareness,<br />
Of the horrors, that they face with fairness.<br />
Let's stand together, as a united force,<br />
To give the survivors, a path to recourse.</p>
<p>Because girls are not just used objects,<br />
They are not just there for men's subjects.<br />
They are human beings, with worth and value,<br />
And it's time we acknowledge, and pursue.</p>
<p>Justice for the survivors, and a world of change,<br />
Where they are seen, as more than just strange.<br />
Where they are celebrated, for their strength,<br />
And their resilience, goes to great lengths.</p>
<p>So let's stand up, and speak out,<br />
Against this crime, that fills us with doubt.<br />
Let's be a voice, for the ones in pain,<br />
And let's never forget, that they are not to blame.</p>
<p>They say she asked for it,<br />
Because of what she wore,<br />
Her body was on display,<br />
So she must have wanted more.</p>
<p>But did they ask her for her consent,<br />
Or even look into her eyes?<br />
Did they ask her how she feels,<br />
Or hear her silent cries?</p>
<p>No, they took what they wanted,<br />
And left her broken and used,<br />
Blaming her for their actions,<br />
As if she had nothing to lose.</p>
<p>But she's not a thing to be taken,<br />
Or an object to be used,<br />
She's a human being with emotions,<br />
And a soul that's been bruised.</p>
<p>She deserves to be respected,<br />
And to live without fear,<br />
To be treated as an equal,<br />
And have her voice be heard loud and clear.</p>
<p>We need to change the narrative,<br />
And shift the focus to the crime,<br />
Stop blaming and shaming the victim,<br />
And hold the perpetrator accountable every time.</p>
<p>Let's teach our children about consent,<br />
And the value of respect,<br />
To build a world where everyone's safe,<br />
And no one feels the need to deflect.</p>
<p>We can make a difference,<br />
By standing up for what's right,<br />
And showing love and compassion,<br />
To those who've lost their light.</p>
<p>Let's stop the blaming and shaming,<br />
And start healing from within,<br />
To create a world where everyone,<br />
Can live without fear and sin.</p>
<p>For every girl who's been violated,<br />
And blamed for the crime,<br />
We stand with you in solidarity,<br />
And vow to fight until the end of time.</p>
