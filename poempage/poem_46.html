            <h1>Scars Which Remain</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Innocence ripped<br />
By a predator's grip,<br />
In shadowed corners,<br />
Or in plain sight,<br />
Victims of a blight.</p>
<p>The pain deep inside<br />
No place left for pride,<br />
Raging rivers of shame,<br />
Repeating the same,<br />
Stories never to tame.</p>
<p>Trapped like a caged bird,<br />
Voice unheard,<br />
Tears that fall like rain<br />
Again and again<br />
Whispers that remain.</p>
<p>Broken promises, shattered dreams,<br />
The unheard screams,<br />
Of the girls who suffer and fall,<br />
Victims of exploiters standing tall,<br />
Feeding on their innocence like gall.</p>
<p>Betrayed by ones they trusted,<br />
Children of the ones they lusted,<br />
Lost in a world that doesn't care,<br />
Scarred for life, an unanswered prayer,<br />
Living in fear, a nightmare.</p>
<p>The pain can't be undo,<br />
Searing pain that feels brand new,<br />
Actions echoing through time<br />
A trauma so deafeningly loud it's like chimes,<br />
A life lived not knowing sublime.</p>
<p>But to all those who have suffered,<br />
Hear my pleas, don't be deterred.<br />
For although the scars might last,<br />
Shatter mirrors of the past,<br />
Your survival is a testament to strength unsurpassed.</p>
<p>She drags herself through each long night,<br />
A prisoner of shame, can't take the light,<br />
Her dreams shattered, her trust, and hope,<br />
All lost to men and society's dope.</p>
<p>She walks alone down city streets<br />
Her fear a constant beat<br />
As hands reach out to grab her<br />
She learns to mistrust and murmur</p>
<p>The leers of men, the catcalls too<br />
All things she's learned to misconstrue<br />
For in this world of pain and fear<br />
Her body is not hers to steer</p>
<p>She must navigate constant threats<br />
And the notion that she owes something to all men she meets<br />
The power they hold over her<br />
A constant threat that will never defer</p>
<p>In the workplace, her body's on display<br />
A flirtation that she must silently obey<br />
Her silence is demanded from on high<br />
As she attempts to maintain a professional disguise</p>
<p>Her worth, it seems is only in her curves<br />
And any attempt towards power, she truly unnerves<br />
So she bites back tears, and screams aloud at night<br />
As she struggles to maintain her right</p>
<p>Then war comes, and with it horror<br />
As bodies degrade and the world crumbles further<br />
She fights for her life, but also her soul<br />
To keep her dignity as bullets rain and bombs roll</p>
<p>She endures torture and degradation<br />
As men use her body for their salvation<br />
She holds on to the small glimmers of hope<br />
That someday she'll break free of this chokehold rope</p>
<p>And though it's hard, she still believes<br />
In a future where justice greets survivors with ease<br />
Where their bodies are respected, and power relinquished<br />
And they're no longer forever forced to be at the mercy of those who've<br />
relinquished</p>
<p>So if you're reading this, please take a stand<br />
Fight against this violence, like boulders in the sand<br />
Together we can create a world that respects women's rights<br />
Where each survivor can hold her head up high and spread her wings to<br />
take flight.</p>
<p>I hear the stories of shattered souls<br />
Of women victimized, exploited, and controlled<br />
By those who seek only to destroy<br />
To take what they want, without care or joy</p>
<p>I hear the cries of those in pain,<br />
Their tears like acid, searing stains,<br />
The wounds too deep to bear or feign,<br />
The hurt they'll carry till life wanes.</p>
<p>I hear the stories whispered through the night<br />
How they held them down, and took what was theirs.<br />
Their innocence, their freedom, lost to might<br />
With bloody fists and violent, sordid stares.</p>
<p>A life once pure, now forever changed,<br />
By hands that took what wasn't theirs,<br />
The scars left burning, like a flame,<br />
On souls once bright, now full of tears.</p>
<p>The story is not new nor strange,<br />
Women violated by men's games,<br />
In homes or streets, it's all the same,<br />
Violence knows no bounds nor names.</p>
<p>For some, it's husband, father or sons,<br />
Those who were meant to be their shields,<br />
In secret places, alone or among,<br />
They tear off trust, and shatter dreams.</p>
<p>But not just there, it's everywhere,<br />
In offices, schools, parties too,<br />
Men in power who do not care,<br />
To them, it's only pleasure, that's true.</p>
<p>And then, there are wars and conflicts,<br />
Where women bear more than the guns,<br />
Raped by enemies or their own kin,<br />
The trauma, hard to undo or stun.</p>
<p>Their days are haunted by unspeakable fear<br />
A paralyzing constant in every breath<br />
Memories that colour each waking tear<br />
How they long for sleep and escape from death.</p>
<p>An unwanted touch, a degrading word<br />
A look that lingers too long on tender flesh<br />
A world where they're mere objects to be heard<br />
And hopes of rescue are just another mesh.</p>
<p>Exploitation lingers long after,<br />
Leaves in its wake, a life in tatters,<br />
The loss of confidence and laughter,<br />
Hollow souls with closed-off rafters.</p>
<p>In dark alleys and quiet streets<br />
They lurk and wait for their prey to meet<br />
Their hands rough, their eyes filled with lust<br />
They show no mercy, no sense of just</p>
<p>But not all who suffer at the hands of men<br />
Are accosted in the shadows, nowhere near a den<br />
Some face trauma from those they know<br />
From family members who don't let them go</p>
<p>A young girl forced to stay with kin<br />
Who abuse and rape her, and blackmail her within<br />
Threatening harm to her loved ones if she speaks<br />
Forcing her to hide her pain and keep her defeat</p>
<p>Others face exploitation in daylight<br />
At work, they're told they're inferior, everything not quite right<br />
And so they must kneel and submit<br />
Saying yes when inside they beg to quit</p>
<p>Cornered in elevators, summoned to private rooms<br />
Told that their value lies solely in their sexual plumes<br />
Made to feel less than, small and weak<br />
Treated with disrespect and forced to act meek</p>
<p>Such trauma leaves scars, both physical and mental<br />
It's never forgotten, leaving them feeling just rental<br />
As if their bodies don't belong to them;<br />
But to those who abuse, use, and never condemn</p>
<p>In sticky silence, she weeps alone,<br />
Her heart shattered, her soul unknown,<br />
Beneath the shadows, she's drenched in fear,<br />
Forced to suffer in a world so drear.</p>
<p>How can she speak? How can she tell?<br />
Of the pain inside, the endless hell?<br />
No one believes, no one hears,<br />
Only dismissal, only jeers.</p>
<p>Her life began as a canvas so clean,<br />
Filled with promise and hope, all unseen,<br />
Small hands reaching for what could be,<br />
With eyes full of wonder and soul so free.</p>
<p>But fate can be cruel in a world so cold,<br />
Where predators lurk, so bold and bold,<br />
And innocence is stolen without a care,<br />
Like a thief in the night, with no love to spare.</p>
<p>From homes where trust was supposed to thrive,<br />
To workspaces where power games thrive,<br />
To the streets, that promised escape,<br />
An unforgiving world with no mercy or grace.</p>
<p>Her body used, her soul ripped apart,<br />
A victim of pain, so sharp like a dart,<br />
Exploited, violated, and left to die,<br />
With no way to escape, no goodbyes.</p>
<p>She screams in silence, unheard, unseen,<br />
Her nightmares no more, never again.<br />
How does one heal from such a tragedy?<br />
A lifelong battle that's a constant emergency.</p>
<p>She is not alone, nor is she weak,<br />
The strength of survival we must seek,<br />
We must lift our broken sisters to shine,<br />
For hope never dies, a light so divine.</p>
<p>In the silence of the night,<br />
She remembers every slight,<br />
Every touch, every word,<br />
That left her feeling absurd.</p>
<p>She's a survivor of abuse,<br />
And her story is not a ruse,<br />
She's fought battles on her own,<br />
In the darkness, all alone.</p>
<p>She was just a girl back then,<br />
With no voice, no power, no zen,<br />
Her abuser took what he pleased,<br />
And left her feeling diseased.</p>
<p>Her innocence was ripped away,<br />
And it haunts her to this day,<br />
The memories are a constant pain,<br />
That drives her nearly insane.</p>
<p>She's not alone in her plight,<br />
Many others have lost their light,<br />
Taken advantage of and used,<br />
Their bodies beaten and bruised.</p>
<p>It happens in the workplace,<br />
Where they're forced to save face,<br />
Or on the street, in the night,<br />
Where they struggle with all their might</p>
<p>She sits alone in the darkest of nights<br />
Her world a blur, a maze of frights<br />
Her mind consumed with endless pain<br />
A heart shattered beyond all gain</p>
<p>A victim of lust and monstrous desire<br />
Her spirit crushed under the fire<br />
Of men who sought her body's pleasure<br />
And left her soul without any measure</p>
<p>Their hands upon her like cruel beasts<br />
Her body used as their secret feast<br />
Their power over her commanding<br />
To leave her with no voice or understanding</p>
<p>But she is not weak, this woman strong<br />
Her spirit resilient, unbreakable lifelong<br />
Though scars she may carry deep within<br />
Her strength a testament to courage akin</p>
<p>She refuses to be defined by their crimes<br />
Her spirit takes flight to healing chimes<br />
Her voice now heard a powerful force<br />
To change the world's deadly course</p>
<p>For every woman whose voice has been silenced<br />
Let us stand with them, our hearts aligned<br />
Against the monstrosity that tears us apart<br />
We rise as one, a collective beating heart.</p>
<p>It's time to take a stand, to fight against this plague,<br />
to never again turn a blind eye to the victims' rage<br />
We must empathize, listen and learn,<br />
And call out those who think it's okay to watch others burn.</p>
<p>For every victim, a warrior rises,<br />
Taking back control of their bodies and believing in surprises<br />
Hope springs anew with every survivor<br />
A testament to the strength that they possess to thrive with vigor.</p>
<p>We know not the agony they bear<br />
Cause the wounds they carry are hidden deep<br />
Weighted emotions they cannot share<br />
Feelings that never let them truly sleep.</p>
<p>And when you see them walking 'round<br />
Remember not to judge, but lend an ear<br />
For in silence much suffering is found<br />
And the quiet ones could use you near.</p>
<p>So let us speak not with mere words<br />
We must take a stand, make a shift<br />
For how can we dream of freedom cohered<br />
When half of our nation is broken and stiff?</p>
<p>Now is the time to draw the line</p>
<p>Speak up and out for what we believe<br />
Love and acceptance, pure and fine<br />
And put an end to all deceiving grieve.</p>
<p>No more excuses, no more hiding<br />
It's time to take action, it's time to step up<br />
The darkness cannot keep on residing<br />
When enough people say, "That's enough."</p>
<p>For within each survivor stands<br />
A person of strength and inspiring grace<br />
Their scars merely tell of their journey's land<br />
"And yet, I rise," they boast of their race.</p>
<p>So let us raise our voices high<br />
And lift each other up to the light<br />
Together, we'll break every lie<br />
And make a safe and loving world ignite.</p>
