            <h1>Darkest Sunset</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>To whom have we blamed till long ?<br />
But the real monster continued to kill innocent souls along,<br />
Who is to blame in this darkening time,<br />
When so many have been subjected to crime?<br />
For whom are we turning a searching eye,<br />
As innocent girls must suffer and cry?</p>
<p>Soft innocence used as a weapon of fate,<br />
The faces of sweet lasses filled with hate.<br />
What fearful power doth hold up their hand,<br />
Deeming that these young victims must endure such pain?</p>
<p>The blackest hearts can weaponize fear;<br />
Young girl's lives thrown in disarray and queer.<br />
Our world's foundations swept out from beneath;<br />
Young girls stand broken in stagnant tears beneath.</p>
<p>So now we must take up justice's call;<br />
Our souls must show that villains won't win at all!<br />
Know this the fight for justice shall never wholly end,<br />
Nowhere else but here good must rise upon evil bent!</p>
