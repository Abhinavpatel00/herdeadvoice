            <h1>Her Crushed Wings</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>In a house that once was a home,<br />
Lived a girl who was all alone,<br />
Her family, the ones who should protect,<br />
Were the ones who caused her to deflect.</p>
<p>Their love was tainted with violence and hate,<br />
Their hands, once gentle, now would berate,<br />
Her body, her soul, her every being,<br />
Leaving scars that no one was seeing.</p>
<p>Her mother, once kind and caring,<br />
Now caused her daughter much despairing,<br />
Her father, once strong and brave,<br />
Now made her feel like a helpless slave.</p>
<p>The siblings, once her closest friends,<br />
Now joined in the abuse and its deadly ends,<br />
Their fists and words like daggers sharp,<br />
Cutting deep, leaving a lasting mark.</p>
<p>And so she wrote, in her diary each night,<br />
Of her pain, her fear, her will to fight,<br />
And though her family had made her feel small,<br />
She knew that someday, she would stand tall.</p>
<p>For the power of words, of love, of hope,<br />
Is a force that can help one cope,<br />
With the darkest of nights and the hardest of days,<br />
And bring one closer to the light's warm rays.</p>
<p>So though this girl's story may be tragic,<br />
Her spirit, her words, are truly magic,<br />
And may they inspire us all to stand,<br />
Against abuse and hate, hand in hand.</p>
