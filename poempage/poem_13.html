            <h1>The Business Of Relations</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>It starts with the birth of a girl,<br />
Parents dread the thought of the dowry they'll swirl.</p>
<p>A life of struggle, of saving every dime,<br />
Just to marry off their daughter in time.</p>
<p>But even then, it's not enough,<br />
The demands keep rising, the pressure is rough.</p>
<p>Gold, cash, cars, and property,<br />
All for a marriage that's meant to be.</p>
<p>And then the groom's family enters the scene,<br />
With their list of demands, so obscene.</p>
<p>The girl's family must comply,<br />
Or risk bringing shame to their name.</p>
<p>dowry, the curse on society,<br />
A barbaric practice that must cease to be,<br />
A system built on greed and pride,<br />
Where girls are sold like goods to buy.</p>
<p>The girl's dreams and aspirations are shattered,<br />
Her life was no longer her own, but what the groom's family mattered.</p>
<p>She's a prisoner, a slave to their whims,<br />
Her worth is measured in material things.</p>
<p>And if she fails to meet their demands,<br />
She's abused, tortured, and everyday harmed.</p>
<p>Her fate left to the mercy of fate,<br />
Her life in tatters, her soul full of hate.</p>
<p>We must break the shackles of this curse,<br />
And ensure that every girl can live without fear.</p>
<p>It's time for us to take a stand,<br />
And put an end to this practice, oh so grand.</p>
<p>Let's empower our girls to chase their dreams,<br />
To be fearless and confident, to achieve the impossible it seems.</p>
<p>Let's break down the walls of this system so wrong,<br />
And give every girl a chance to be strong.</p>
<p>For it's time to rewrite the story,<br />
Of girls who are sold, and live so sorry.</p>
<p>Let's pledge to make a difference,<br />
And free every girl from this vicious sentence</p>
