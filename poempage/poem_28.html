            <h1>Kindness The Ray Within</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Kindness is a virtue that can heal,<br />
A touch of compassion that we can feel,<br />
It’s the balm that soothes our pain,<br />
The ray of hope amidst the rain.</p>
<p>A kind word or gesture goes a long way,<br />
It can brighten up someone's day,<br />
It costs nothing to be kind,<br />
But the impact it has is one of a kind.</p>
<p>In a world full of chaos and strife,<br />
Kindness is the thread that binds us to life,<br />
It’s the beacon of light that shows us the way,<br />
The guiding force that leads us astray.</p>
<p>It’s easy to be caught up in our own needs,<br />
But kindness is about fulfilling others' deeds,<br />
It’s about lending a hand to those in need,<br />
To help them overcome the impossible deed.</p>
<p>It’s the act of giving without any expectation;<br />
Of spreading joy and love in every nation,<br />
It’s the language that all can understand,<br />
The thread that unites every land.</p>
<p>Kindness is the antidote to hate,<br />
The medicine that cures all our fate,<br />
It’s the force that can conquer all,<br />
The power that can make us stand tall.</p>
<p>So let’s be kind in all that we do,<br />
And spread this message to others too,<br />
For a little kindness can go a long way,<br />
And brighten up someone's darkest day.</p>
<p>The world is vast and full of wonder,<br />
But sometimes, we're left to ponder,<br />
What is our place in this great expanse?<br />
What is the meaning of our life's dance?</p>
<p>We search for answers, high and low,<br />
In books, in people, in places we go,<br />
We seek the wisdom of the sages,<br />
And look for clues in ancient pages.</p>
<p>But what if the answers we seek,<br />
Are not found in words we speak?<br />
What if the truth lies in our hearts,<br />
In the compassion that each of us imparts?</p>
<p>Kindness is the key, this we know,<br />
It's what makes our world a better show,<br />
It's what binds us, heart to heart,<br />
And makes us stronger, right from the start.</p>
<p>Kindness is not a simple act,<br />
It's a way of life, that we must enact,<br />
It's not just about being nice,<br />
It's about being good, being wise.</p>
<p>We must be kind to ourselves first,<br />
For it's from within that kindness bursts,<br />
We must nurture our own self care,<br />
And show ourselves the love we all deserve to bear.</p>
<p>But kindness must not stop with us,<br />
We must spread it far and wide, without fuss,<br />
We must be kind to those we meet,<br />
To strangers on the street, and even those we greet.</p>
<p>Kindness is a powerful force,<br />
It can change the world, without remorse,<br />
It can heal the hurt, and soothe the pain,<br />
And bring sunshine, after the rain.</p>
