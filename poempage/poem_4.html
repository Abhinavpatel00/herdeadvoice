            <h1>Shattered Yet Unbroken</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>The sorrow that doth plague her soul<br />
A pain that none but she doth know<br />
Her tears fall like summer rain<br />
A silent plea for love in vain</p>
<p>What horrors must making everything endure<br />
That she doth cry and wail so pure<br />
A heart so burdened with such strife<br />
That every night she takes her life</p>
<p>Her spirit was crushed, her body weak<br />
No refuge left for her to seek<br />
A victim of a cruel design<br />
A prisoner of a world unkind</p>
<p>How the world hath failed this fair<br />
Injustice doth her life ensnare<br />
But yet she doth not yield to fate<br />
For hope still lingers, though it's late</p>
<p>With every tear, she finds the strength<br />
To carry on, despite the length<br />
Of the path, she must tread alone<br />
Her courage is like a diamond stone</p>
<p>And so she cries, with a heart so bold<br />
For all the tales that go untold<br />
For every soul that suffers so<br />
For every heart that longs to know</p>
<p>May heaven's light guide her way<br />
And bring her solace every day<br />
For in her tears doth lie the power<br />
To conquer all, in life's darkest hour</p>
