            <h1>Her Smothered Breaths</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>When she wants to speak up for her rights<br />
She is told to silence, put out of sight<br />
For looking outwards, fighting in vain<br />
They're seen as monsters and scorned again.</p>
<p>A lifetime of violence year after year<br />
All the while almost no one hears<br />
The cries and voices that plead for justice<br />
It's silenced instead with centuries of dust.</p>
<p>It's sad when victim is seen with shame,<br />
As if the guilt lies in her name.</p>
<p>To be devastated and violated this way,<br />
So much to bear no words can say.</p>
<p>So, many of us must rise to defend her right<br />
To join forces as a mass uprising with might.<br />
We have a moral obligation to stand strong,<br />
And protect the victims of this horrible wrong.</p>
