            <h1>Comprehending Humanity</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>The power that we hold within,<br />
As men, it is not a thing of sin.<br />
But when we use it to dominate,<br />
And exploit girls, it's a cruel fate.</p>
<p>Our masculinity should not define,<br />
The way we treat the feminine divine.<br />
Sex should not be a power game,<br />
But a moment of love, without shame.</p>
<p>But many men seek to assert,<br />
Their power, making girls hurt.<br />
They rush to see their animal side,<br />
And ignore the purity of the moment's tide.</p>
<p>We use sex to show our might,<br />
To strike a girl's vagina with our sight.<br />
Our girlfriends know how rude we are,<br />
In bed, we treat them like a cheap cigar.</p>
<p>This power transfer, when unfulfilled,<br />
Is released in ways that should be killed.<br />
We massage arms, slap hips and grope,<br />
Asserting power, losing hope.</p>
<p>This poverty of the mind,<br />
Is a common disease we find.<br />
Some control it, some don't,<br />
All want to dominate and flaunt.</p>
<p>Our inner poverty dominates,<br />
Our girlfriends and wives, we deprecate.<br />
Do we love them in those moments,<br />
Or just use them to satisfy our elements?</p>
<p>Do girls think that rape is love,<br />
When they join us, like a dove?<br />
Have we tried to understand,<br />
Their consent, and the power in our hands?</p>
<p>Our mindset needs to be questioned,<br />
Our actions, our thoughts, our intention.<br />
We make mistakes, we must admit,<br />
And learn from them, to benefit.</p>
<p>Love should not be a power game,<br />
But a connection that we can claim.<br />
We must respect girls, their innocence,<br />
And teach the cruel ones, a lesson intense.</p>
<p>For the word, "girl" does not define,<br />
Their actions, their nature, their design.<br />
We must stand with innocence,<br />
And not those who cause turbulence</p>
<p>Compassion for those who abuse,<br />
Is hard to find, impossible to choose,<br />
Their victims, vulnerable and weak,<br />
Are left with scars, both physical and bleak.</p>
<p>How can we claim to love and care,<br />
When we inflict pain, and cause despair?<br />
Our wives and girlfriends, whom we hold dear,<br />
Deserve our love, and nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Don't put beauty in a category,<br />
Unattainable, or too extraordinary,<br />
Girls deserve respect, not just lust,<br />
Treat them with kindness, not disgust.</p>
<p>In the workplace, stop stalking friends,<br />
Their actions could have deadly ends,<br />
Rapists are born, not made in a day,<br />
Teach them now, or they'll surely pay.</p>
<p>Looking is fine, but don't cross the line,<br />
Staring, gawking, is not fine,<br />
Respect boundaries, and their privacy,<br />
Don't reduce them to mere commodity.</p>
<p>Gender equality is a cause worth fighting,<br />
To end the oppression, and stop the biting,<br />
Of those who abuse their power,<br />
And make girls' lives a living shower.</p>
<p>Let us stand with the innocent,<br />
And bring to justice the malevolent,<br />
Teach the cruel, and show them the way,<br />
For a better tomorrow, a brighter day.</p>
