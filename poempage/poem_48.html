            <h1>The Nameless Truth</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>In the depths of pain, we find the truth<br />
The darkness reveals what we thought was smooth<br />
The struggles of the soul, the battles we fight<br />
In the midst of chaos, we find the light</p>
<p>I see her, quiet and alone<br />
In a world she can’t call home<br />
Trembling from what came before<br />
This pain she can’t ignore.</p>
<p>She hides behind a mask of shame<br />
Forced to play a cruel game<br />
Her body, no longer her own<br />
Leaves her feeling torn and alone.<br />
It was in the place she should feel safe<br />
But instead, it became a dark loathsome space<br />
A trap she could never escape<br />
A nightmare that continued to take shape.</p>
<p>She longs to scream and be set free<br />
But fear holds her hostage for all to see<br />
Her pleas for help echo unheard<br />
As the world moves on without a word.</p>
<p>But she’s not alone, there are so many more<br />
Whose harrowing tales go untold<br />
We need to hear them, behind each scar is a story<br />
To let them know their stories we’ll hold.</p>
<p>It happens in our very homes<br />
Where supposed love rots to the bones<br />
Hands that should hold us with tender care<br />
Now become tools that cause despair</p>
<p>The workplace too can breed danger<br />
Where promotions hinge on a sexual stranger<br />
their bodies used as currency<br />
Do they work for them or for their dignity?</p>
<p>And in public spaces, they are never free<br />
their bodies subject to scrutiny<br />
Catcalls and stares, unwelcome touches<br />
A constant battle for our own clutches</p>
<p>The eyes closed or open just a dilemma<br />
It's life , not a scene of cinema<br />
To establish or create sense of fear in minds<br />
He used to hurt her in each possible way he finds</p>
