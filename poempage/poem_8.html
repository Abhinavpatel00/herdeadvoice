            <h1>Her Broken Rise</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>The pain of a soul that's shattered,<br />
It's pieces scattered, tattered and battered,<br />
Feeling as though it's unworthy of breath,<br />
Struggling to hold on, wishing for death.</p>
<p>The memories and marks of violence and hate,<br />
Haunt her still, a burden too great,<br />
Robbing her peace, leaving her in fear,<br />
Sleeping on a bed of death, so near</p>
<p>No words can capture the depth of her pain,<br />
The trauma, the shame, the loss, the disdain,<br />
For what was done to her, without her consent,<br />
A cruel act that no one should ever invent.</p>
<p>But though the darkness may seem endless,<br />
There is hope, there is light, there is tenderness,<br />
In the arms of those who love and support,<br />
She can find strength, and a path to resort.</p>
<p>Let her know, that though it may seem dire,<br />
She's not alone, and her pain is not entire,<br />
For there are those who stand by her side,<br />
Ready to help, ready to provide ,</p>
<p>So let us pledge to stand against hate,<br />
To speak out against violence, to not abate,<br />
For in the fight for justice, we shall prevail,<br />
And the broken shall rise, and their light shall never pale.</p>
<p>Let's stop blaming the victims for what they wear,<br />
Or for being out late or for being there,<br />
Rape is not caused by the clothes they choose,<br />
But by the rapist's desire to abuse.</p>
<p>Let's stop making excuses for the perpetrators,<br />
And stop minimising the impact on the survivors,<br />
Rape is a violent violation of consent,<br />
And the damage it does cannot be undone or spent.</p>
<p>Let's educate our young ones on healthy relationships;<br />
On consent and boundaries, on respectful trips,<br />
For when we teach respect and empathy;<br />
We foster a culture of love and sympathy.</p>
<p>Let's hold the perpetrators accountable,<br />
And let the survivors know they are valuable,<br />
For in the pursuit of justice, we must not rest,<br />
Until rape and sexual violence are put to the test.</p>
<p>The conversation around rape must change,<br />
To one of empathy, support, and range,<br />
Where the survivors are uplifted and heard,<br />
And the rapists are held accountable and deterred.</p>
<p>So let us reframe this conversation,<br />
And work together for a better nation,<br />
Where rape is seen as a grave disgrace,<br />
And a culture of consent takes its rightful place.</p>
