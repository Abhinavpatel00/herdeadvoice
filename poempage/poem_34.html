            <h1>Life which is bought and sold</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>In this world of love and union<br />
Where hearts beat with a sweet fusion<br />
There's an ugly practice that prevails<br />
One that leaves a trail of tears and wails</p>
<p>Grooms with their demands on dowry<br />
Judging girls by their father's money<br />
Is this what love and marriage is?<br />
A transactional agreement with a financial twist?</p>
<p>Oh, the irony of it all<br />
As love is supposed to stand tall<br />
Above all materialistic gain<br />
Yet, here we are, stuck in this bane</p>
<p>The worth of a woman reduced to her wealth<br />
A commodity to be bought and sold by stealth<br />
Is this what our society has become?<br />
A place where love and compassion are numb?</p>
<p>Grooms with their list of demands<br />
On cars, gold and prime lands<br />
And if the father can't comply<br />
The bride-to-be is left to die</p>
<p>Left alone to face the taunts<br />
Of a society that wants<br />
Nothing more than a grand show<br />
Of wealth, power and status quo</p>
<p>The bride's family left in despair<br />
Struggling to meet the groom's unfair<br />
Demands on their financial reserves<br />
Leaving them with shattered nerves</p>
<p>Oh, the irony of it all<br />
As love is supposed to stand tall<br />
Above all materialistic gain<br />
Yet, here we are, stuck in this bane</p>
<p>Why must the worth of a woman be<br />
Reduced to her family's property?<br />
Why must she be bought and sold<br />
For the sake of wealth and gold?</p>
<p>It's time for us to break free</p>
<p>From this age-old atrocity<br />
To stand up against these demands<br />
And take a stand for what's truly grand</p>
<p>Love, respect and understanding<br />
These are the values worth demanding<br />
In a world where the worth of a woman<br />
Is not measured by her father's money</p>
<p>Dowry, the weight of gold and pride,<br />
A burden borne by a groom's side,<br />
A custom old, entrenched in greed,<br />
A bartering of daughters, a heinous deed.</p>
<p>The price is set, a life is sold,<br />
A daughter's worth, in coins of gold,<br />
The groom's family, demands their right,<br />
A sum so high, it's beyond sight.</p>
<p>The bride's family, bows to the demand,<br />
For societal norms, they must withstand,<br />
They sell their land, their savings, their all,<br />
To ensure their daughter, never falls.</p>
<p>But what of love, and what of joy,<br />
In this transaction, where's the employ?<br />
What of the girl, and her wishes too,<br />
Is she not worth, more than gold so few?</p>
<p>Her dreams are crushed, her voice unheard,<br />
Her life is bartered, her freedom blurred,<br />
A victim of tradition, of patriarchy,<br />
A life bound in chains, a lifelong misery.</p>
<p>Dowry, a curse, a societal bane,<br />
A custom steeped in deep-rooted disdain,<br />
Let us break these shackles, and set her free,<br />
And let her live, her life with dignity.</p>
