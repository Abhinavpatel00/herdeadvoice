            <h1>Broken Soul's Screams of Silence</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>The horror of it all, the pain that's felt<br />
By girls who suffer in silence, as if dealt<br />
A cruel hand by fate, left with no choice<br />
But to endure the abuse, with no voice</p>
<p>It starts at home, with family and kin<br />
The very people who should protect and win<br />
Their trust, but instead they shatter it<br />
Leaving the girl to suffer, bit by bit</p>
<p>The father who should be a source of love</p>
<p>Betrays her, and turns into a monster to shove<br />
His desires onto her, without any care<br />
For the damage he inflicts, or the scars he'll leave bare</p>
<p>The brother who should be a friend and guide<br />
Preys on her vulnerability, and makes her hide<br />
In fear and shame, as if she's to blame<br />
For his actions that are nothing but a shame</p>
<p>The uncle who should be an elder to respect<br />
Uses his power to force her, and neglect<br />
Her cries for help, leaving her to suffer alone<br />
Feeling helpless and trapped, with nowhere to run</p>
<p>And what about the mother who's supposed to care<br />
She stands by and watches, as if it's fair<br />
That her daughter's innocence is taken away<br />
By those who are supposed to keep her safe and sway</p>
<p>The pain is unbearable, the scars deep<br />
As the girl struggles to keep<br />
Her sanity intact, and her will to survive<br />
Against those who seek to take away her life</p>
<p>She was just a girl, innocent and pure<br />
Until her own family made her feel unsure<br />
Of what love really meant, of what was right<br />
As they took from her the most sacred of light</p>
<p>They whispered promises of protection and care<br />
But then violated her body, leaving her in despair<br />
With each touch, each assault, each degrading word<br />
They chipped away at her spirit, like a cruel, sharp sword</p>
<p>Her body became a battleground, a site of war<br />
As they tore away her autonomy, her right to say "no more"<br />
She was trapped in a nightmare, a hell of their making<br />
And no one was there to hear her heart breaking</p>
<p>Her screams went unheard, her tears unseen<br />
As they continued to abuse her, so cruel and obscene<br />
And she wondered why this was happening to her<br />
Why she couldn't escape, why there was no cure</p>
<p>For the pain that they caused, for the trauma they inflicted<br />
As they used her body, her soul, like a toy, so unrestricted<br />
And she felt so alone, so isolated in her pain<br />
As they left her broken, shattered, again and again</p>
<p>The touch of terror, the weight of fear,<br />
A trauma that's too heavy to bear,<br />
A darkness that engulfs the soul,<br />
A wound that refuses to be made whole.</p>
<p>The body, once a temple of peace,<br />
Now a battlefield where violence won't cease,<br />
The mind, once a garden of dreams,<br />
Now a barren wasteland with endless screams.</p>
<p>The pain of abuse, a shattering blow,<br />
Like a wildfire, it consumes us whole,<br />
Like a serpent's venom, it spreads and bites,<br />
Draining us of hope, as day turns to night.</p>
<p>Metaphors fail to capture the pain,<br />
Words are powerless, as the tears rain,<br />
Similes can't express the trauma we bear,<br />
As we try to heal, to find some repair.</p>
<p>Personifying the pain, it takes on a life,<br />
A demon that cuts us like a knife,<br />
An enemy that we fight every day,<br />
A shadow that refuses to go away.</p>
<p>The imagery, vivid, in shades of gray,<br />
A memory that never fades away,<br />
The scars that we bear, etched in our soul,<br />
A tale of suffering that's yet to be told.</p>
<p>The symbolism, the weight of a chain,<br />
A weight that we carry, like a ball and chain,<br />
A prison that we cannot escape,<br />
A sentence we serve, without any respite.</p>
<p>The alliteration, a sound so sharp,<br />
A scream that we stifle, deep in our heart,<br />
The assonance, a whisper so soft,<br />
A plea for help, that we barely cough.</p>
<p>The consonance, a moan so low,<br />
A plea for mercy, that no one will know,<br />
The repetition, a mantra we say,<br />
A hope for survival, day after day.</p>
<p>The rhyme, a melody that we hum,<br />
A song of sorrow, that we sing alone,<br />
The rhythm, a beat that we follow,<br />
A dance with fear, that we cannot disown.</p>
<p>The onomatopoeia, a sound so raw,<br />
A cry for help, that echoes and draws,<br />
The hyperbole, an exaggeration so strong,<br />
A pain that's intense, that lasts so long.</p>
<p>The irony, a cruel twist of fate,<br />
A punishment we didn't anticipate,<br />
The allusion, a reference to pain,<br />
A history of suffering, that we can't contain.</p>
<p>The enjambment, a break so sharp,<br />
A fracture that leaves us in the dark,<br />
The caesura, a pause so long,<br />
A moment of silence, when nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>The euphony, a harmony so sweet,<br />
A healing that's slow, but sure to meet,<br />
The cacophony, a discordant sound,<br />
A suffering that's real, that we can't confound.</p>
<p>The anaphora, a repetition so strong,<br />
A message that we want to prolong,<br />
The epiphora, a repetition so clear,<br />
A hope that's renewed, every year.</p>
<p>The symploce, a repetition so bold,<br />
A truth that's spoken, that never grows old,<br />
The metonymy, a name we give,<br />
A trauma that lives, that we can't outlive.</p>
<p>The synecdoche, a part of a whole,<br />
A wound that's deep, that takes its toll,<br />
The antithesis, a contrast so stark,<br />
A pain that's felt, that leaves its mark.</p>
<p>The apostrophe, a plea so loud,<br />
A call for justice, that we shout out,<br />
The clich√©, used with irony,<br />
A statement of truth, that's hard to see.</p>
<p>The pain of abuse, a burden we bear,<br />
A story that's real, that we cannot repair,<br />
The trauma we face, an endless fight,<br />
A hope for justice, that shines so bright.</p>
<p>Innocence shattered, trust broken,<br />
The weight of shame, a heavy token.<br />
Silenced by fear, unable to speak,<br />
The pain and trauma, forever unique.</p>
<p>A teacher's hand, a predator's touch,<br />
The innocence of childhood, ripped asunder much.<br />
Unaware of danger, we blindly trust,<br />
Yet monsters lurk, waiting to pounce and thrust.</p>
<p>The memories haunt, never to fade,<br />
A wounded heart, forever unafraid.<br />
To speak out, to demand justice,<br />
To fight for healing, amidst the chaos.</p>
<p>The scars remain, etched on the soul,<br />
A reminder of a time, we lost control.<br />
Yet within the pain, there lies a power,<br />
To overcome the darkness, in the darkest hour.</p>
<p>Through metaphors and similes, we paint the pain,<br />
The personification of trauma, the imagery of shame.<br />
The symbolism of innocence, shattered and torn,<br />
Alliteration of anguish, the consonance of mourn.</p>
<p>The repetition of sorrow, the rhythm of grief,<br />
The rhyme of trauma, a silent, yet thundering thief.<br />
The onomatopoeia of cries, the hyperbole of fear,<br />
The irony of justice, a victory never quite clear.</p>
<p>The allusion to a world, where safety is the norm,<br />
The enjambment of hope, where healing takes form.<br />
The caesura of resilience, the euphony of strength,<br />
The cacophony of outrage, the anaphora of events.</p>
<p>The epiphora of stories, the symploce of pain,<br />
The metonymy of healing, the synecdoche of the slain.<br />
The antithesis of silence, the apostrophe to hope,<br />
The cliche subverted, a warrior refusing to cope.</p>
<p>The darkness of trauma, never to be denied,<br />
Yet within the pain, there is hope, we shall abide.<br />
For the power of healing, the strength of survivors,<br />
Shall rise above the pain, with hope as their drivers.</p>
