            <h1>Her Broken Wings and Healing Scars</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Innocent children, so pure and true,<br />
Their bodies violated, their spirits subdued.<br />
Captivity and imprisonment, a life of shame,<br />
Their abusers walk free, their victims to blame.</p>
<p>Metaphors of darkness, their souls in chains,<br />
As they struggle to break free from the pain.<br />
Their bodies betrayed, their trust in shattered,<br />
Their cries ignored, their innocence battered.</p>
<p>Personified monsters, with evil intent,<br />
Taking advantage of the vulnerable, with no relent.<br />
Their twisted desires, a sickening disease,<br />
Inflicting their trauma, with such ease.</p>
<p>Metaphors of fire, burning deep within,<br />
As the victims fight back, and refuse to give in.<br />
With courage and strength, they resist and persist,<br />
Breaking free from their tormentors, no longer dismissed.</p>
<p>The imagery of struggle, a fight to survive,<br />
Against those who seek to harm and deprive.<br />
Their voices now heard, their stories told,<br />
Their resilience and bravery, forever bold.</p>
<p>The metaphors of light, shining through the pain,<br />
As the victims reclaim their lives again.<br />
No longer prisoners, no longer trapped,<br />
Their souls and spirits, forever unwrapped.</p>
<p>For these innocent girls, so young and small,<br />
We must stand together, to hear their call.<br />
To end sexual violence, to break the chains,<br />
And give them the freedom, they so rightly claim.</p>
<p>Innocent girls, with hearts so pure,<br />
Their pain hidden, but still so sure.<br />
Tears they cry, in silence and alone,<br />
Their hearts aching, their spirits unknown.</p>
<p>Their pain runs deep, like a river untamed,<br />
Carrying with it, memories of shame.<br />
Betrayed by those they trusted most,<br />
Their innocence lost, a cruel cost.</p>
<p>Their bodies violated, their souls torn apart,<br />
A pain so deep, it grips their heart.<br />
Memories haunt them, day and night,<br />
Shadows of the past, an endless fight.</p>
<p>The pain they carry, a burden so heavy,<br />
Their hearts and minds, never ready.<br />
To face the world, with heads held high,<br />
For the pain they feel, will never die.</p>
<p>Society fails them, time and time again,<br />
Blaming the victim, for the sins of men.<br />
Their pain dismissed, their voices unheard,<br />
A system broken, a tragedy absurd.</p>
<p>But still they rise, with strength and grace,<br />
Brave warriors, taking back their space.<br />
Their pain transformed, into power and might,<br />
As they stand tall, in the face of the fight.<br />
Innocent and pure, a child at play,<br />
Her world shattered in one horrid day.</p>
<p>A monster lurking, a predator in disguise,<br />
Stealing her light with sickening lies.</p>
<p>She trusted him, the one who stole her trust,<br />
A vile creature of malice and lust,<br />
He ripped away her childhood, her sense of self,<br />
Leaving her scarred, in a state of mental health.</p>
<p>Her body, once a temple, defiled by sin,<br />
The marks left behind a permanent grin,<br />
Her pain runs deep, it's etched into her soul,<br />
Her trauma so great, it's hard to control.</p>
<p>The shame and guilt that follows her around,<br />
An unwelcome guest in her mind, always found,<br />
The world can be so cruel and unforgiving,<br />
Leaving her feeling helpless, barely living.</p>
<p>The memories linger, the flashbacks burn,<br />
The terror and horror of that fateful turn,<br />
The monster's voice echoes, it won't go away,<br />
A haunting reminder, day after day.</p>
<p>The scars may fade, but they'll never disappear,<br />
The pain may lessen, but it's always near,<br />
A wound that's been opened, never to heal,<br />
A heart left broken, unable to feel.</p>
<p>But hope remains, a light in the dark,<br />
A voice that whispers, you're more than a mark,<br />
You're a survivor, a warrior, a force to be reckoned,<br />
A strength that's grown, from what once was beckoned.</p>
<p>The journey is long, the road is tough,<br />
But she's not alone, she's got her rebuff,<br />
A support system that's there to stay,<br />
Helping her through, come what may.</p>
<p>The monster's voice grows fainter each day,<br />
As she learns to find her own way,<br />
Through therapy, love, and faith in herself,<br />
She finds the courage to seek out her own wealth.</p>
<p>But now she finds the strength to speak,<br />
Her story, though painful, must be seen and heard unique.</p>
