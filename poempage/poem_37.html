            <h1>Search of Light in Dark</h1>
<h2>Aditi Jogdand</h2>
<p>Her dreams of angel's stories<br />
Every moment surrounded with unseen worries</p>
<p>She tried so hard to fight<br />
But didn't found that light</p>
<p>Her soul tired by the pain of not painting wounds<br />
Her breaths near to death, even when oxygen around</p>
<p>The delightfulness of her heart so bright<br />
Her soul soul says now only death was right</p>
<p>Wetness of her eyes and trembling lips<br />
And a slow and continuous river over her cheeks</p>
<p>one who never scared of darkness nor even depth<br />
But lost something called faith</p>
<p>She don't have will to bring a desire of a sea<br />
but there's something more that she can see</p>
<p>Little little moments started bringing peace and calm<br />
Along with the shadow and warmth</p>
<p>Her wounds of inhumanity still cracks her heart<br />
But now she learning slow what's her worth</p>
