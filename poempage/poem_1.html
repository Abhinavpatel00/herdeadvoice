            <h1>Her Untold Silent Screams</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Butterflies in her dreams were replaced by fear<br />
Life looks like a dark, miserable road without cheer<br />
She holds this emptiness that can't be filled<br />
And there is desolation that veils the glinted field</p>
<p>As she stands paralyzed and strengthless<br />
Victim of sexual violence makes senseless<br />
Still, she gathers all her courage and says a prayer<br />
That justice will cure her inner dullness, despair</p>
<p>But she knows deep down that she's not to blame<br />
For the heinous acts inflicted on her frame<br />
It's not her fault that someone chose to harm<br />
And leave her with these scars so deep and stark</p>
<p>She deserves to be heard, to be believed<br />
And for the perpetrator to be rightly grieved<br />
For the justice to be served and seen<br />
And for her shattered soul to finally glean</p>
<p>The hope and light that once shone so bright<br />
Before the darkness took over her life<br />
She can reclaim her power and voice<br />
And take control of her own path and choice  </p>
<p>It won't be easy, the road ahead is tough<br />
But with love, support, and courage enough<br />
She can heal, grow, and thrive<br />
And create a life that feels truly alive  </p>
<p>She can find her faith again in the midst of the pain<br />
And rise above the trauma that once did reign<br />
She can reclaim her joy, her dreams, her hope<br />
And never again feel like she can't cope.<br />
The marks she got never gonna disappear<br />
Her heart trembled with fear  </p>
<p>No one should be reduced to this painful state<br />
Everyone deserves their basic human right to be safe<br />
That can't be bought or sold and certainly not with pain<br />
But strengthened within all hearts that come together and gain<br />
This is a fight against injustice, abuse, and crime<br />
Let's work towards a world where every being feels sublime</p>
