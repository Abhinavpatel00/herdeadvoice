            <h1>A Tale of Hypocrisy and Redemption</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>In this world of hypocrisy and shame,<br />
She seeks boys who bring her fame,<br />
But what of those who raise their voice,<br />
Against injustice and make a choice?</p>
<p>He who truly care and show,<br />
Sympathy and kindness that we know,<br />
Are often left to fade away,<br />
As she chases the ones who play.</p>
<p>This wrong thinking, it must be said,<br />
Is what makes him feel misled,<br />
Fame and wealth are all she see,<br />
Not the heart that beats within thee.</p>
<p>He who saves girls from trafficking,<br />
Gets no love or attention for his deserving,<br />
While those who entertains on screen with fake action ,<br />
Often become the object of her affection.</p>
<p>The sad truth is that she turned her eye blind;<br />
To him who have a heart so kind,<br />
And the ones she see, will continue to contribute,<br />
To the exploitation of girls who are destitute.</p>
<p>But if we stop chasing wealth and fame,<br />
And start valuing a his true aim,<br />
Then maybe we can put an end;<br />
To the abuse and the pain that we intend.</p>
<p>So let us learn to look soul inside,<br />
And see the person, not just the pride,<br />
For it is only then we'll find;<br />
A love that's pure and truly kind.</p>
<p>And if she refuses to marry a boy;<br />
Who demands dowry as their ploys.<br />
And values him who's bright , do social work,<br />
Then maybe the abuse will stop and not lurk.</p>
<p>In the search for love, which boy will she choose?<br />
The one who raises his voice or shows sympathy too?<br />
But why does her nature show such hypocrisy?<br />
Expecting goodness, yet always falling for those with fame and money.</p>
<p>Skewed perspective of her mislead him, causing wrong choices and<br />
much noise<br />
Where they believe exploiting others can be overlooked with fame and<br />
toys.<br />
The world seems to value those who are rich and famous,<br />
A truth that can't be denied, no matter how outrageous.</p>
<p>It's disheartening to see his work towards the better world;<br />
gets short area , short term love and affection<br />
And the ones who just show offs with money, gold<br />
Are well known to the world for their fake action</p>
<p>When he hears her crave for fame and wealth,<br />
He feels like an outsider, true to himself.<br />
Her desires seem foreign, to him unknown,<br />
He works to change the world, to be better known</p>
<p>A world where everyone is valued for their true worth,<br />
And girls are seen beyond their physical features from birth.<br />
A world where love is not based on wealth and fame,<br />
But on compassion, sincerity, and a deeper flame.</p>
<p>Let's create a society where true heroes are celebrated,<br />
And their good deeds are never understated.<br />
Where love is not based on superficial things,<br />
But on what truly makes our hearts sing.</p>
<p>She chased money, fame, and charm,<br />
But neglect him whose heart so warm.<br />
She want someone who can treat her right,<br />
But failed to see who stands up for her fight.</p>
<p>He tried to be good, to be kind,<br />
But society values fame over a gentle mind.<br />
The world is cruel, it's hard to survive,<br />
So some versions of him turn wrong just to thrive.</p>
<p>Her dream of a prince, a perfect mate,<br />
But only sees the surface and not the weight.<br />
She judged them by the looks, by the cars,<br />
And missed the one who would heal their scars.</p>
<p>He yearn for love, for connection,<br />
But society values wealth over affection.<br />
He worked hard, he sacrificed,<br />
But in the end, he is left with hollow eyes.</p>
<p>She crave attention, validation,<br />
But forget the true value of appreciation.<br />
She fall for the player, the heartless one,<br />
And miss the one who would never be gone.</p>
<p>He strive for respect, for honour,<br />
But society values power over valour.<br />
He fought for justice, for the greater good,<br />
But in the end, he is misunderstood.</p>
<p>She want a hero, a saviour,<br />
But only see the fame and the flavor.<br />
She ignored the one who's fighting the war,<br />
And missed the one who would never ignore.</p>
<p>He hoped for understanding, for empathy;<br />
But society values dominance over sympathy,<br />
He tried to listen, to comfort, to care;<br />
But in the end, he is left with despair.</p>
<p>She need to change, to open her eyes,<br />
To see the good, to value the wise,<br />
She must learn to judge by the heart,<br />
And not by the money, fame, or art.</p>
<p>He need to change, to break the mold,<br />
To see the value of love and hold.</p>
<p>He must learn to appreciate the soul,<br />
And not just the power, money, or goal.</p>
