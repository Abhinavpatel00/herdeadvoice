            <h1>Love : the power of healing</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Innocence is stolen, hearts left scarred<br />
As selfish actions leave their love marred<br />
Trauma inflicted, wounds deep and raw<br />
Mental state shattered, a painful flaw</p>
<p>Consequences of such actions severe<br />
Ruining lives, breeding hate and fear<br />
It's time to understand love's true meaning<br />
To cherish it, and end this darkening screening</p>
<p>Let's embrace love in its purest form<br />
Respect, care and trust, a new norm<br />
Let's put an end to forced desires<br />
And reignite the passion of love's fires.</p>
<p>It's easy to be swayed by desires so strong,<br />
To demand your own pleasure, ignore what's wrong.<br />
But remember, your wife is not just for sex,<br />
She's a partner in life, who needs love and respect.</p>
<p>If you force her to do what she doesn't want,<br />
You'll inflict wounds on her spirit that will always haunt.<br />
She'll be filled with anger, sorrow and pain,<br />
And never be able to trust you again.</p>
<p>So it's better to start loving her, body and soul,<br />
And appreciate the moments that make you whole.<br />
For love is not just about physical pleasure,<br />
It's about deep connections that you'll always treasure.</p>
<p>If you cherish her and make her feel secure,<br />
She'll open up to you and love you even more.<br />
Her heart will be filled with warmth and affection,<br />
And she'll find solace in your loving attention.</p>
<p>But if you abuse her, she'll feel trapped and alone,<br />
A victim of your selfishness, powerless and unknown.<br />
The trauma you cause will never fade away,<br />
And haunt her for the rest of her days.</p>
<p>So choose your path wisely, and treat her with care,<br />
For love and respect are what your wife deserves to share.</p>
<p>Remember, her heart is fragile, and needs your embrace,<br />
So cherish her always, and let love fill every space.<br />
The call for gender equality,<br />
A noble cause we must uphold with sincerity<br />
For too long women have faced the brunt<br />
Of societal norms and cultural stunt</p>
<p>Their beauty deemed attainable or unattainable<br />
Reduced to objects, often found vulnerable<br />
But who will show compassion to their plight<br />
When their attackers are filled with spite</p>
<p>It starts with teaching our children well<br />
About gender equality, a message we must tell<br />
No difference between sister and friend<br />
For the plant has different flowers, yet they blend</p>
<p>At work, we must stop our friends<br />
From behaving like stalkers, for it offends<br />
A behaviour that can lead to dire consequences<br />
Or teach others to follow, and repeat offences</p>
<p>Looking at girls is one thing,<br />
But staring and doing X rays, an alarming fling<br />
We must acknowledge the difference<br />
And ensure that it never crosses the fence</p>
<p>Forcing a woman to have sex against her will<br />
Inflicts trauma and leaves a mental anguish<br />
Rather, let love and compassion reign<br />
For such moments hold their own significance, don't constrain</p>
<p>Let's shun the momentary pleasure<br />
That leaves behind an emotional treasure</p>
<p>And understand the importance of love<br />
That brings joy, peace, and happiness thereof</p>
<p>The consequences of ignoring their plight<br />
Are terrible, a black mark on humanity's sight<br />
Let's show empathy, love, and respect<br />
For women, who deserve nothing but the best.</p>
