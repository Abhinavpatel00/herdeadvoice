            <h1>Caged By Despair</h1>
<h2>Aditi Jogdand</h2>
<p>Once her Heart filled with light, without any fear ,<br />
Innocent soul with bright eyes so clear ,<br />
Beauty of life she was yet to share,<br />
But fate had other plans in it's store ,<br />
A sudden cruel twist , her childhood tore.</p>
<p>With wings once soaring,now torn and broken<br />
her heart weighed heavy her happiness stolen<br />
But the world around her a stormy sea,<br />
A tempest of advice, but none could set her free</p>
<p>Her trembling heart beats, tremendous questions inside<br />
The increasing doubt in the eyes and blame at such a height<br />
Her dreams and hopes, now out of sight<br />
Darkness consumed her days and nights</p>
<p>A captive, in a world so strange<br />
Her innocence, a casualty of change<br />
Her eyes, once sparkling with delight<br />
Now filled with tears, that never take high flight</p>
<p>Her heart, once so full of glee<br />
Now shattered, broken, beyond degree<br />
Her pain, a burden too great to bear<br />
Weight of it, too much to share</p>
<p>Her soul, trapped in a prison of despair<br />
Her mind, haunted by thoughts so rare<br />
Her voice, now silenced, no more to sing<br />
Her heart, now broken, no more to spring</p>
<p>Her spirit, now shattered, no more to soar<br />
Her dreams, now shattered, no more to explore<br />
The suffering she endures<br />
A fate so cruel, she never deserves</p>
<p>But still, she fights to break free<br />
To live a life which was meant to be<br />
Let's stand, by her side<br />
With love and hope, let us provide;</p>
<p>A path to freedom, a light to guide,<br />
A way to heal, and not just hide<br />
Her innocence , light of hope so fair<br />
Her beauty of heart and strength, beyond compare</p>
<p>Let us sing a song, of love and care<br />
And help her heal, her heart repair.<br />
Her voice will no more be stuffed with fear so underserved<br />
And we'll build up a society where our futures preserved</p>
<p>Where brightness of hope will never be dim<br />
And all hearts be safe seem<br />
Where she can dream and grow<br />
And can choose path she wants to go</p>
<p>Where innocent is protected<br />
And cruel traditions rejected<br />
Let's make changes , be wise<br />
Break the cycle of pain and kindness precise</p>
<p>Let's give her a chance to shine which she deserves , and align Where<br />
her heart can finally fly<br />
And her spirit can finally touch the sky<br />
Let's be the change we want to see, And create a world where all can be<br />
free<br />
Where kindness will be our land<br />
And we all hold each other with a helping hand</p>
<p>Where she can dream and heard<br />
Let's built the way for a future which leads humanity upwards<br />
Where her she can speak loud and clear<br />
And her dreams will finally reappear.</p>
