            <h1>Her Trapped Soul</h1>
<h2>Aditi Jogdand</h2>
<p>She is frightened deep inside<br />
Sorrow and hopelessness beside<br />
Surrounded by unseen, threatening presence of them<br />
Which brutally grabs her soul in insecurity and blame  </p>
<p>Her smile faded away with her hopes, dreams for the future<br />
Now just depression, anxiety that's what she nurtures<br />
The curiosity she had as a child<br />
Is bothering massive cyclones which aren't mild  </p>
