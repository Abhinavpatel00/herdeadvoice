            <h1>Her Walk On Empty</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>She was just a child, so innocent and pure<br />
But they took advantage, of that she was sure<br />
It was her own family, who she trusted the most<br />
But they abused her, and left her feeling lost</p>
<p>She tried to speak up, to tell someone the truth<br />
But they blamed her, said she was being uncouth<br />
They said she was lying, that it couldn't be true<br />
And so she suffered, with no one to turn to</p>
<p>Her body felt used, like it wasn't her own<br />
She felt dirty and ashamed, like she had grown<br />
Into something ugly, that no one could love<br />
She felt trapped, unable to rise above</p>
<p>But she was strong, despite what they had done<br />
She refused to be a victim, to be overcome<br />
By the pain and the sorrow, that they had caused<br />
She chose to rise above it all, and not be paused</p>
<p>She sought help, from those who believed<br />
Who listened and supported, and helped her to relieve<br />
The burden of the trauma, that she had to bear<br />
She found hope, and began to repair</p>
<p>Her shattered sense of self, and her broken heart<br />
She learned to love herself, and to never part<br />
From the truth of her worth, as a human being<br />
No longer a victim, but a survivor, strong and seeing</p>
<p>That she deserved love, respect and dignity<br />
And that her past did not define her, or her destiny<br />
She rose above the shame, and the blame<br />
And found peace, in her own name</p>
<p>lets strike at the root, which causes such pain<br />
Let us be the change, and never let it happen again<br />
Her family, who she thought would always be there,<br />
Are now the ones who cause her despair,</p>
<p>Her body, once her temple, now a source of pain,<br />
And in her heart, she bears an unending strain.<br />
She feels lost, alone, and violated,<br />
Wondering how her family could be so misguided,</p>
<p>How they could break the sacred bond of trust,<br />
And inflict on her a lifetime of disgust.</p>
<p>The pain is overwhelming, her tears never ending,<br />
As she struggles to cope with the unspeakable offending,</p>
<p>Betrayed by the ones who swore to love and care,<br />
And now she's left with scars that can never be repaired.</p>
<p>She tries to forget, to move on and forgive,<br />
But the memories remain, haunting her as long as she lives,<br />
The shame, the guilt, the fear that they instilled,<br />
All because of the evil desires they fulfilled.</p>
<p>She's blamed and shamed, as if it's all her fault,<br />
For the actions of those who have no remorse or thought,</p>
<p>And society judges her, as if she deserves the abuse,<br />
As if she's the one who chose to be misused.</p>
