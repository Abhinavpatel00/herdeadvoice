            <h1>Let's Restructure The Narrative</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Mothers fail to teach their sons;</p>
<p>That girls are human just like them,<br />
And sisters fail to educate their brothers;<br />
That girls are not mere playthings or gems.</p>
<p>Why do boys not realize?<br />
That their daughters could be next;<br />
That the same horrors, they inflict on others;<br />
Could be inflicted on their own flesh.</p>
<p>Society is shattered and broken,<br />
A girl can't take a single step without fear,<br />
For every step she takes;<br />
There's someone waiting to leer.</p>
<p>Rape and abuse are rampant;<br />
A girl's body is not her own;<br />
The world is cruel and heartless;<br />
She's left to suffer all alone.</p>
<p>But I refuse to give up hope,<br />
To resign to the world's cruel fate,<br />
I'll work to prevent these crimes;<br />
I'll write, I'll fight, and create!</p>
<p>I know I can't stop everyone,<br />
But I'll do my part to make a change;<br />
To teach boys to respect consent,<br />
And that love is not within their range.</p>
<p>Mutual consent is the only way;<br />
To truly show love and intimacy,<br />
To move from a world of rape and fear,<br />
To a world of true love and serenity.</p>
<p>So I implore you, dear readers;<br />
To spread these thoughts far and wide,<br />
To teach boys the meaning of respect;<br />
And to end this cruel and heartless tide.</p>
<p>Every girl is a daughter, a sister, a friend,<br />
A life full of potential, a journey without end,<br />
But why do we fail to teach our sons,<br />
That other girls are also someone's precious ones?</p>
<p>Mothers, sisters, where do you go wrong?<br />
In raising your sons and brothers to be kind and strong,<br />
Do you forget that the other girls they see,<br />
Are someone's daughters, just like you ?</p>
<p>Why do we boys fails to see,<br />
That our actions can cause misery,<br />
That every girl deserves respect and love,<br />
Not to be treated like an object, like a thing to shove.</p>
<p>Our society is broken, it's true,<br />
And every girl's fear is long overdue,<br />
For every step she takes, there's always a threat,<br />
Of someone waiting to exploit, abuse, or make her regret.</p>
<p>Rape and abuse, they tear us apart,<br />
Leaving scars that never truly depart,<br />
But we cannot lose hope, we cannot despair,<br />
For there is always a way to repair.</p>
<p>We may not have all the answers, all the keys,<br />
But we can start with the power of our words, our pleas,<br />
We can write, we can speak, we can fight,<br />
For justice, for safety, for a future that's bright.</p>
<p>We cannot stop every crime, it's true,<br />
But if we can stop even one, it's a breakthrough,<br />
For that one boy taught to respect and love,<br />
May be the one to end this violence from above.</p>
