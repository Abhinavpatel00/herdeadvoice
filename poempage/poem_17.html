            <h1>Unleash The Fight For Injustice</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>This is a tale that's all too real,<br />
A story that transcends time and place,<br />
Of pain and trauma that girls feel,<br />
A danger lurking in every space.</p>
<p>It happens in homes and in classes,<br />
With children and in neighbourhoods,<br />
A vicious cycle that surpasses,<br />
Any attempts to change its moods.</p>
<p>Ask the girls in your own abode,<br />
And you'll find that this story's true,<br />
The same tale that's oft been told,<br />
Of what they've been subjected to.</p>
<p>The danger lurks in every corner,<br />
A danger that's omnipresent,<br />
A peril that's hard to conquer,<br />
An enemy that's quite incessant.</p>
<p>She wonders if she'll ever feel whole again<br />
Or if this pain will always remain<br />
She wants justice, but it seems so far<br />
In a world that doesn't value who they are</p>
<p>This is not just a story, it's a tragedy<br />
A reality that should fill us with agony<br />
We need to stand up and speak out<br />
To make sure this is not what life is about<br />
In this world, men hold the power,<br />
And women are preyed upon each hour,</p>
<p>It's a scary and sad reality,<br />
One that we must address with clarity.<br />
My friend's message struck me to the core,<br />
If only death was a better score,</p>
<p>For girls who live in constant fear,<br />
Of being violated, with no one near.<br />
I couldn't respond, what could I say?<br />
When girls are assaulted every single day,<br />
From the crowded metros to the empty alleys,<br />
Their safety is compromised, their dignity in valleys.</p>
<p>Even when I accidentally collide,<br />
With a girl who scolds, her anger I can't abide,<br />
I know it's not my fault, but I still feel the shame,<br />
For I know the culprit is a man who has no game.</p>
<p>A man who gropes, a man who leers,<br />
A man who masturbates in public and feeds on fears,<br />
This man is everywhere, and I am he,<br />
A part of a society that lets him be.</p>
<p>He puts his hands on shoulders and waists,<br />
He caresses backs and leaves girls disgraced,<br />
He rubs his penis on buses, on hostel walls,<br />
His actions leave scars, and society mauls.</p>
<p>He gives chocolates and shows off his status,<br />
But when he's done, the girl's life is in hiatus,<br />
Her dreams and aspirations shattered,<br />
Her life forever altered and tattered.</p>
<p>I am ashamed, for these forms are mine,<br />
And I know that I must draw the line,<br />
I must be the change that the world needs,<br />
And ensure that women's rights and safety precedes.</p>
<p>The suffocating girls in this society<br />
Their plight is one that none can deny<br />
Victims of a system that's rigged against them<br />
Their fate determined by the whims of men</p>
<p>It starts with a feeling of power and control<br />
A desire to dominate, to own, to hold<br />
In the bed, it's not about pleasure or love<br />
But the rush of power, the animal inside us, we shove</p>
<p>We're not having sex, we're showcasing our might<br />
To prove to the world we're the kings of the night<br />
Our girlfriends know how rough we can be<br />
In the name of power, we rob them of their dignity</p>
<p>This power is not confined to the bedroom walls<br />
It flows into the streets, into public stalls<br />
Where men grope, touch, and harass with impunity<br />
Their power unchecked, fueled by their masculinity</p>
<p>The power dynamics are clear to see<br />
Men hold the reins, and women are at their mercy<br />
A subtle touch, a grab, a groping hand<br />
A constant reminder that women are not in command</p>
<p>The system is rigged, and the girls suffer<br />
Every day, every moment, it's getting tougher<br />
To exist, to survive, to thrive in a world<br />
Where men hold all the power, and girls are left to unfurl</p>
<p>The power of masculinity, a force to behold<br />
A feeling that's nurtured, from young and old<br />
It's the feeling of control, of dominance and might<br />
A feeling so strong, it clouds our sight</p>
<p>In bed, we show it off, our girlfriends know<br />
We don't make love, we put on a show<br />
We display our power, with every thrust<br />
In that moment, we feel like we must</p>
<p>Our power cannot be contained, it spills out<br />
Into the world, it seeks to shout<br />
We massage arms in crowds, we slap hips<br />
We grope breasts, it's all in our grips</p>
<p>We transfer our power, a subtle ritual<br />
One that's been passed down, from time immemorial<br />
When it cannot be contained, it seeks to reign<br />
Over the world, it seeks to maintain</p>
<p>It's a poverty, a sickness that afflicts us men<br />
We want to dominate, again and again<br />
We deny the existence of suffocating girls<br />
We don't care about their cries or their whorls</p>
<p>Our power blinds us, we can't see the truth<br />
The harm we cause, the damage we ruth<br />
We don't care about their pain, their fears<br />
We revel in our power, in our leers</p>
<p>We must stop and listen, to their voices<br />
We must understand, their choices<br />
We must empathise, with their plight<br />
We must fight for their rights, with all our might</p>
<p>The power of masculinity, it's time to rethink<br />
It's time to let go, of this poisonous ink<br />
It's time to embrace, a new way of being<br />
One that's based on love, and true seeing</p>
<p>We must understand, that power is not a game<br />
It's not something to use, to control or maim<br />
It's something to share, to lift up and empower<br />
It's something to use, to build and empower</p>
<p>In this world where masculinity is power<br />
We dominate, we conquer, we tower<br />
Our ego so fragile, our mind so weak<br />
We seek validation from every girl we seek</p>
<p>Our inner poverty is like a disease<br />
It dominates our actions with such ease<br />
We think we love, but do we really?<br />
Or are we just satisfying our own needs, really?</p>
<p>Our girlfriends and wives, they suffer in silence<br />
Our domination over them, it's violence<br />
We don't understand the situation at hand<br />
We think consent is enough to make a stand</p>
<p>But have we ever asked ourselves, have we tried?<br />
To understand the pain we cause, the tears we've dried<br />
The girl who joined us, did she really think<br />
That love is what we did, with consent, like a wink?</p>
<p>Our mindset is our biggest mistake<br />
We can't see beyond our own ego's sake<br />
Why wouldn't we be mad at seeing someone outside?<br />
When we can't even understand the pain we provide</p>
<p>Our poverty is a curse, a plague upon us<br />
It makes us blind, it makes us unjust<br />
We don't see the suffocating girls in our society<br />
We just want to dominate, in every stage and variety</p>
<p>But let me tell you, my fellow men<br />
There is a way out, a way to end<br />
This poverty that we carry deep inside<br />
It starts with empathy, with opening our eyes wide</p>
<p>We must listen, we must understand<br />
The pain that we cause, with our own hand<br />
We must stop dominating, stop using our power<br />
And start loving, start caring, every minute, every hour</p>
<p>For only then, can we truly be<br />
The men that we aspire to see<br />
The ones who respect, the ones who care<br />
The ones who end this poverty, this despair.</p>
