            <h1>The Fictitious Practice To Slave innocent Souls</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Oh, dowry, a cruel and callous game,<br />
Bringing only misery, sorrow and shame.<br />
A tradition that has no place in modern times,<br />
A scourge that should be purged from all minds.</p>
<p>Let us all take a stand against this vice,<br />
And raise our voices against this injustice twice.<br />
Let us declare our love without any price,<br />
And break the chains of this system so unwise.</p>
<p>For a girl should be cherished, loved and free,<br />
To pursue her passions and her destiny.<br />
Let us create a world where she can thrive,<br />
A world where her worth is never based on a bribe.</p>
<p>So let us pledge to support our sisters dear,<br />
And break the shackles that they live in fear.<br />
Let us fight against this practice so severe,<br />
And end this dowry system once and for all, my dear.</p>
<p>In the game of dowry, it's not just the bride who's caught,<br />
But the groom too, unknowingly, becomes a character of the plot.<br />
A cycle of greed and coercion that repeats over time,<br />
It's a tradition that's deeply ingrained, a cultural crime.</p>
<p>Father forgets that once he too had taken dowry,<br />
And now he's forcing his daughter to bear the same story.<br />
The groom too, blinded by his own ego and pride,<br />
Doesn't realise that he too is on the wrong side.</p>
<p>But the bride, the victim of this cruel game,<br />
Her life is ruined, her dreams go up in flames.<br />
She's bought and sold, her worth measured in gold,<br />
Her happiness and well being, forever put on hold.</p>
<p>It's time to break this cycle of abuse and greed,<br />
To give the bride the respect and love she needs.<br />
A union of two hearts, based on love and trust,<br />
Without any price tag, without any lust.</p>
<p>For a dowry free society, we must fight,<br />
And embrace a new dawn, where love is the only light.<br />
Innocent eyes, so pure and bright,<br />
A precious life that shone so bright,</p>
<p>But the world was cruel and full of plight,<br />
And darkness fell upon her like a blight.</p>
<p>The men around her, so depraved,<br />
An innocent life, they so enslaved,<br />
Their lustful hands, so cruelly waved,<br />
And shattered her soul, as she lay there un saved.</p>
<p>From father to brother, uncle and friend,<br />
Their evil ways, they did not end,<br />
Aunts and uncles, they did offend,<br />
And the horror continued, with no defend.<br />
They took from her, what was not theirs,<br />
Innocent flesh, they treated like wares,<br />
No one to hear her, no one to care,<br />
A life destroyed, in the hands of the snares.</p>
<p>And though she tried, with all her might,<br />
To fight against the endless night,<br />
The darkness won, and snuffed her light,<br />
Leaving the world, in utter fright.</p>
<p>This is the fate, of too many girls,<br />
Their lives destroyed, by society's whirls,<br />
We must stand up, against these wrongs unfurls,<br />
And protect their lives, with all our pearls.</p>
