            <h1>The Unshaded Darkness</h1>
<h2>Aditi Jogdand</h2>
<p>It is terrible to even get heard right now<br />
Feel she feels don't deserve to even breathe somehow<br />
She isn't sure whether she is alive or dead<br />
The marks and memories brings her in the feeling of lying on deathbed</p>
<p>Each thing wasn't this way before ,<br />
Now just darkness and self blame breaths as her soul's core</p>
<p>Why don't we hear and accept which is true?<br />
Why do we need to keep her voice suppressed with fear, emotional<br />
blackmailing's glue?<br />
The darkness of her heart will still be the same<br />
Or at least now, just stop this cheap game !</p>
