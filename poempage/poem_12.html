            <h1>The Murderer Industry</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>In the darkness of the night,<br />
Her tears fall like raindrops might,<br />
Forced into a life of shame,<br />
Sold for men to use, a never-ending game.</p>
<p>Her body is not hers to own,<br />
As she is forced to be shown,<br />
In videos for the pleasure of men,<br />
Her soul screams out, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>In the darkness of the night,<br />
Her tears fall like stars might,<br />
Forced to sell her body and soul,<br />
To satisfy the desires of men, she's lost control.</p>
<p>Her worth is measured in dollar bills,<br />
Her body a product for men to thrill.<br />
No longer human, but just an object,<br />
Her humanity stripped away, it's now the subject.<br />
Her pain and suffering, invisible to most,<br />
Hidden behind closed doors, it's easy to boast.</p>
<p>Of a world that's just, and treats all as equal,<br />
But the reality is harsh, and its effects so lethal,<br />
Her body is a prison, her mind a maze,<br />
She's trapped in a world with no escape, no way to blaze,<br />
A path to freedom, to break the chains,<br />
Of a life that's filled with so much pain.</p>
<p>But hope still lingers, a flame in the dark,<br />
A light that can guide her to a brand-new start,<br />
To reclaim her worth, and her dignity,<br />
To break free from this life of indignity,</p>
<p>The life she leads is one of pain,<br />
Her cries unheard, her heart in chains.<br />
Her dreams of freedom now long gone,<br />
Her spirit broken, her light now gone.</p>
<p>She was once a girl with hopes and dreams,<br />
But now she's nothing, or so it seems,<br />
Just a commodity, a product to sell,<br />
A victim of a world that treats her like hell.</p>
<p>In the shadows, she hides her face,<br />
Her eyes downcast, her heart displaced,<br />
For all the hurt that she has known,<br />
Has left her feeling so alone,<br />
And yet, she fights to find a way,<br />
To live another day .</p>
<p>To heal her wounds, to mend her soul,<br />
To rise again, and be made whole,<br />
For she knows that she is not alone,<br />
That there are others who have known,<br />
The pain and sorrow that she feels,<br />
And have risen up, to break the seals.</p>
<p>To fight for justice, to make a stand,<br />
To bring an end to this wicked land,<br />
Where girls sold, bought and used,<br />
Their bodies broken, their spirits abused,<br />
And though the road ahead is long,<br />
And the journey hard, and sometimes wrong.</p>
<p>She knows that there is hope to be found,<br />
In the hearts of those who are truly sound,<br />
For in their eyes, she sees a light,<br />
That shines so bright, and breaks the night,<br />
And shows her that she is not alone,<br />
That there is hope, and a way to be shown.</p>
<p>So let us stand, and fight for those,<br />
Who are trapped in lives of woes,<br />
And bring an end to this cruel fate,<br />
And lift them up, to a better state.</p>
<p>In a world that's meant to be free,<br />
Girls are trapped, they cannot flee,<br />
From the horrors that surround them all,<br />
Their voices silenced, their backs against the wall.</p>
<p>Forced into a life they did not choose,<br />
Their bodies sold, for men to abuse,<br />
Their dreams and hopes, now crushed and broken,<br />
Their souls shattered, their spirits stolen.</p>
<p>They live in fear, and endless pain,<br />
Their worth measured in what they can gain,<br />
For the men who buy them, they're just a toy,<br />
A source of pleasure, their feelings void,<br />
Their bodies are not theirs to own,<br />
They're used and abused, and then thrown.</p>
<p>Into a world of darkness and despair,<br />
A life they never wanted, never thought was fair,<br />
And yet, they fight to keep their flame alive,<br />
To survive another day, and to strive,<br />
To break free from the chains that bind,<br />
To escape the darkness, and leave it behind.</p>
<p>Their spirits may be broken, but not their will,<br />
They have the courage to rise, and to fulfil,<br />
Their dreams of freedom, of a life they choose,<br />
Where they're not just objects, but humans too,</p>
<p>So let us stand with them, and fight their flight,<br />
To bring an end to this cruel plight.<br />
To build a world where all can be free,<br />
And girls can live a life of dignity,</p>
<p>The porn industry, where tears can be seen,<br />
Where bodies are objectified, for all to see,<br />
A place where pleasure is the only goal,<br />
And the human spirit is left without a soul.</p>
<p>It's a world that preys on our desires,<br />
Exploiting our needs, and fueling our fires,<br />
With images that leave us wanting more,<br />
And leave our souls empty, and our hearts sore,</p>
<p>It's a world that tells us that sex is just a game,<br />
A game where all are players, and there's no shame.<br />
But the reality is far from what we're shown,<br />
For the porn industry is a world of its own,<br />
It's a world where girls are used and abused,<br />
Their bodies sold, and their spirits bruised,</p>
<p>For the pleasure of those who pay to see,<br />
A life that's broken, and no longer free.<br />
It's a world where consent is just a word,<br />
And the dignity of innocent girls often blurred,</p>
<p>Where their worth is measured in how they look,<br />
And their value is placed in a porn star's book,<br />
It's a world that's built on exploitation,<br />
A world that feeds on our fascination.</p>
<p>With the human form, and its many ways,<br />
But it's a world that leaves us lost in a daze,<br />
For we're sold a lie, that sex is just for fun,<br />
But the reality is that our souls are done.</p>
<p>For the porn industry takes more than it gives,<br />
Leaves us empty, and unable to live,<br />
In the shadows, hidden away from the light,<br />
Lies the dark world of porn, a harrowing sight.</p>
<p>Where girls are exploited and used for gain,<br />
Their bodies violated, their souls in pain,<br />
The industry's greed knows no bounds,<br />
Forcing girls to perform, leaving them bound.</p>
<p>Used and abused, with no hope for escape,<br />
Their dreams and aspirations, forever erased,<br />
Raped and beaten, treated as mere objects,<br />
Their pain and trauma, society neglects.</p>
<p>Chained and enslaved, their bodies for sale,<br />
Their lives destroyed, their dignity pale,<br />
Their cries for help fall on deaf ears,<br />
As they're forced to face their darkest fears.</p>
<p>Trapped in a cycle of abuse and shame,<br />
Their lives forever tarnished, a scarlet stain,<br />
The porn industry's dark secrets, hidden from view,<br />
Exploiting the weak and vulnerable, their hearts askew.</p>
<p>Their worth measured by their looks, and nothing more,<br />
Their humanity is stripped away, as they're pushed to the floor.<br />
But we cannot stay silent, we must speak out,<br />
Against the injustice that leaves so many in doubt.</p>
<p>We must fight for the girls, who are left in pain,<br />
And create a world, where their dignity can reign,</p>
<p>For every girl who's trapped, and every girl who's hurt,<br />
We must stand with them, and lift them from the dirt.</p>
<p>And build a world, where their worth is known,<br />
And their dreams and aspirations can forever be grown.</p>
<p>Let us break the prison, that hold them down,<br />
And create a world, where their dignity will abound.</p>
<p>For every girl deserves a life that's free,<br />
From the bondage of abuse, and from the porn industry,</p>
