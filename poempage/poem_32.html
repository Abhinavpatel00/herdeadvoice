            <h1>Innocent Heart's Broken Courage</h1>
<h2>Aditi Jogdand</h2>
<p>Her soul brutally harmed<br />
She feels unarmed<br />
One's heart full of love and care<br />
Lost her courage , dare</p>
<p>Bearing unbearable shamefulness and self blame kills her from inside<br />
Where there was once happiness, innocence , goals reside<br />
The twinkling stars did hold themselves on pause<br />
Where are those basic rights and those laws ?</p>
<p>Just a child small and bold<br />
Only a gentle heart and smile that's what she hold<br />
The little girl child called as the form of goddess durga , kaali<br />
Why did forced her to get stuck in blame's dreadful valley</p>
<p>Did you thought she is voiceless , dumb object ?<br />
Who gave you the right of her soul to dissect ?<br />
That little girl who deserved to fly<br />
Bothering a lot but still silent cry</p>
<p>She prayed that at least once you have heard<br />
What she going through and beared<br />
Nothing can express her trauma and that fear<br />
Everything was clear but didn't appear</p>
