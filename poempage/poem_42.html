            <h1>He Needs To Unlearn the Toxic Learnings</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>The pain that we feel, the anguish that we bear<br />
When our sisters and daughters are treated so unfair<br />
Every moment, every day, they fear for their lives<br />
In a world that's filled with darkness, where no light thrives</p>
<p>I'll write, I'll give efforts, I'll work for justice until I die<br />
I know I can't stop everyone, but I'll still try<br />
If someone can stop someone, and that someone stops another<br />
It will become everyone, and we'll see the world together</p>
<p>If boys from childhood are taught to respect, to love and to care<br />
To understand the real meaning of consent and not just to dare<br />
Then one day, it will end, the world will change<br />
And girls will be free, no longer be afraid</p>
<p>It's not enough to just say "boys will be boys";<br />
And accept that girls are just toys for their joys<br />
We must challenge toxic masculinity every day<br />
And show that real strength comes in a different way</p>
<p>Girls should be able to walk without fear<br />
Without the constant threat of someone coming near<br />
To take what is not theirs, to violate their rights<br />
To leave them scarred, traumatized, with sleepless nights</p>
