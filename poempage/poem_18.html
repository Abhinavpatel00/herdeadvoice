            <h1>Reanalyse Masculinity</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>As I ponder on this matter,<br />
The weight of guilt and shame<br />
Crushes down upon my heart<br />
For I know I share the blame.</p>
<p>For every time I stayed silent<br />
When my friends spoke in crude ways<br />
I gave them power to objectify<br />
And prey on girls as if they're prey.</p>
<p>And for every time I dismissed<br />
The cries and pleas of a victim<br />
I contributed to a culture<br />
That treats women as slave.</p>
<p>It's time to admit our faults<br />
And take responsibility too<br />
For the crimes and injustices<br />
That women suffer, it's not new.</p>
<p>We need to raise our children right<br />
Teach them that gender is not a divide<br />
That every person deserves respect<br />
And dignity, it's not something to be denied.</p>
<p>Let's not make girls' beauty<br />
A means of measuring their worth<br />
For they are more than just their looks<br />
And their value extends far beyond the earth.</p>
<p>And in our workplaces and schools<br />
Let's call out bad behaviour<br />
And make it known that such actions<br />
Will not be tolerated, nor ever.</p>
<p>For it's the little things we do<br />
That can have the biggest impact<br />
In changing the toxic culture<br />
And paving the way for a better contract.</p>
<p>In the heat of passion, we forget<br />
The weight of our actions, the toll they'll exact<br />
On those we claim to love, to cherish, to protect<br />
Our desire becomes an all consuming threat</p>
<p>We seek to dominate, to assert our power<br />
To prove our manliness in that fleeting hour<br />
We forget the purity of the moment<br />
As we rush to leave our mark, to make it potent</p>
<p>But what about her, the one we claim to care for?<br />
What about her feelings, her desires, her core?<br />
Do we stop to ask, to listen, to understand?<br />
Or do we plow ahead with our own demands?</p>
<p>We forget that love is more than just physical<br />
It's emotional, mental, spiritual<br />
It's a bond that goes beyond the skin<br />
A connection that goes deep within</p>
<p>We forget that our actions have consequences<br />
That our selfishness has repercussions<br />
That the trauma we inflict is not just physical<br />
But emotional, mental, and spiritual</p>
<p>We forget that love is a partnership<br />
That it requires communication and consent<br />
That forcing someone to do something against their will<br />
Is not love, but a violation of their dignity and free will</p>
<p>It's time to wake up, to see the truth<br />
That our actions have a ripple effect, a proof<br />
That we are not just hurting our partners<br />
But also perpetuating a culture that's darker</p>
<p>We need to educate ourselves and our children<br />
On gender equality, respect, and consent<br />
On the beauty and worth of every human being<br />
Regardless of their gender or anything</p>
<p>We need to stand up and speak out<br />
Against stalking, harassment, and assault<br />
To be allies, not bystanders<br />
To break the silence, to be the difference makers</p>
<p>It's time to redefine what it means to be a man<br />
To reject the toxic masculinity that's a sham<br />
To embrace a new definition of strength and power<br />
One that's based on respect, love, and honour</p>
<p>So let's start with ourselves, with our own actions<br />
Let's make a change, let's have a reaction<br />
Let's love our partners in their fullness<br />
Without reducing them to objects of our lust and roughness.</p>
<p>In this world of chaos and pain,<br />
Where oppression seems to reign,<br />
We must look within ourselves,<br />
And change the way we think and feel.</p>
<p>For too long we've let our desires,<br />
Lead us to commit heinous crimes,<br />
Against those who are weaker,<br />
And those who cannot fight.</p>
<p>But now it's time to take a stand,<br />
To change our ways, to understand,<br />
That love is what we truly need,<br />
Not violence or dominance or greed.</p>
<p>We must learn to control our urges,<br />
And see the value of consent,<br />
For it's not about what we want,<br />
But about mutual respect.</p>
<p>Let's show love to our wives and partners,<br />
Not try to force them to our will,<br />
For the power of love is greater,<br />
Than any momentary thrill.</p>
<p>And as we make these changes within,<br />
We'll send a better energy to the world,<br />
A light of hope that shines so bright,<br />
For every boy and every girl.</p>
<p>So let's replace oppression with love,<br />
And send a message to the world,<br />
That we can be better, we can change,<br />
And create a better world for all.</p>
