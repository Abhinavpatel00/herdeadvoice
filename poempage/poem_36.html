            <h1>She's Surviving the Unthinkable</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>I was a 6 year old girl, so innocent and pure,<br />
When the world turned dark, and I was no longer sure<br />
What was right and wrong, what was love and hate,<br />
When the touch of a trusted hand became my fate.<br />
He came in the night, when I was alone,<br />
Whispering words that chilled me to the bone,<br />
Promising me secrets that no one else would know,<br />
But I didn't want to listen, I didn't want to go.</p>
<p>But he was older, wiser, and so much stronger,<br />
And I was just a child, no match for his hunger,<br />
So I gave in, I let him have his way,<br />
And I felt my soul die a little every day.</p>
<p>For years, he took from me, what should have been mine,<br />
My body, my mind, my spirit, he left me behind,<br />
A shell of the girl I used to be,<br />
Lost in a world of pain and misery.</p>
<p>I tried to tell someone, anyone who would listen,<br />
But they said I was lying, that it was just fiction,<br />
That no one would do such a thing to a child,<br />
That it was all in my head, that I was just wild.</p>
<p>So I kept it inside, the shame and the fear,<br />
Hoping that one day, the end would be near,<br />
But the memories stayed, like a cancerous growth,<br />
Eating away at my soul, like a terrible oath.</p>
<p>I hated myself, for what he had done,<br />
For the way he had made me feel, for what I had become,<br />
I felt dirty, tainted, and forever scarred,<br />
And I couldn't escape the darkness, no matter how hard.</p>
<p>But then something changed, a spark in the night,<br />
A glimmer of hope, a flicker of light,<br />
I realized that I was not to blame,<br />
That I was not the one who should feel shame.</p>
<p>It was him, the abuser, the monster within,<br />
Who had committed the sin, who deserved the spin,<br />
Of the wheel of justice, that would make him pay,<br />
For what he had done, day after day.</p>
<p>And so I began to heal, to fight back,<br />
To reclaim my life, and to attack,<br />
The demons that haunted me, the voices in my head,<br />
Telling me that I was better off dead.</p>
<p>I learned to love myself, to forgive the past,<br />
To see the beauty in life, and to make it last,<br />
I found my voice, my power, my strength,<br />
And I used it to break free, to go to any length.</p>
<p>And though the journey was long, and sometimes hard,<br />
And the memories still lingered, like a playing card,<br />
I knew that I was not alone, that others had survived,<br />
And that I could make it, if I just tried.</p>
<p>So here I am, standing tall, and strong,<br />
A survivor of the abuse, a fighter for the wronged,<br />
And though the scars still remain, and the pain still stings,<br />
I am free, and that is all that really means.</p>
<p>She is a survivor, a warrior of sorts,<br />
With scars that run deep and emotions that distort.<br />
She has seen the worst of humanity's face,<br />
And survived the horror of childhood's disgrace.</p>
<p>The memories linger, haunting her days,<br />
A relentless nightmare that never fades.<br />
The touch of another sends shivers down her spine,<br />
A reminder of the violation that was once hers to confine.</p>
<p>The shame is a constant, a burden she bears,<br />
A heavy weight that she cannot share.<br />
For who could understand the pain and fear,<br />
Of a child who was robbed of their innocence, dear?</p>
<p>The anger burns bright, a fire within,<br />
Fuelled by the injustice and the world's sin.<br />
She rails against the cruelty that she has known,<br />
And vows to never let it define her alone.</p>
<p>But healing is a journey, a path that is long,<br />
With twists and turns that leave her feeling wrong.<br />
The triggers are many, the road is tough,<br />
But she holds on to hope, for it is enough.</p>
<p>The scars may never fade, but she can choose,<br />
To let them define her, or to let them loose.<br />
To live a life that is rich and full,<br />
And find the beauty in each moment, no matter how small.</p>
<p>She is not just a survivor, she is a thriver,<br />
A phoenix rising from the ashes of fire.<br />
She chooses to live, to love, to laugh,<br />
And leave the past behind, a distant photograph.</p>
<p>For she is more than the pain that was dealt,<br />
More than the secrets that were kept.<br />
She is a person, with dreams and hopes,<br />
And she will not be defined by her past's scope.</p>
<p>So let her rise, let her soar,<br />
And leave the darkness behind, forevermore.<br />
For she is a survivor, a warrior of sorts,<br />
With scars that run deep, but a spirit that sports.</p>
