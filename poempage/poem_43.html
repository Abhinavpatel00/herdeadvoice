            <h1>Broken Pieces Of Faith</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>She knelt down and prayed with all her might,<br />
Begging God to save her from her plight.<br />
But the heavens remained still and quiet,<br />
No saviour came to end her tormenting night.</p>
<p>She was left alone, broken and hurt,<br />
Betrayed by the One she thought would avert<br />
The tragedy that had befallen her life,<br />
Leaving her with a sense of insecurity and strife.</p>
<p>Her faith was shattered, her trust was gone,<br />
As she struggled to cope and carry on.<br />
The fear of being violated again,<br />
Haunted her thoughts and caused her pain.</p>
<p>No words can describe her heart's despair,<br />
As she lost her innocence and her prayer.<br />
Her once unbreakable faith was now stolen,<br />
And her spirit left bruised and swollen.</p>
<p>Yet, she did not give up, she did not yield,<br />
For she knew that she had to heal and rebuild.<br />
She took control of her life once again,<br />
And refused to let the darkness win.</p>
<p>She cried out to God, with all her trust,<br />
To save her from being so unjust,<br />
Raped, violated and torn apart,<br />
Her cries in vain, shattered heart.</p>
<p>Lost, hopeless, feared to live,<br />
Her faith destroyed, her soul to give,<br />
God did not answer, he wasn't there,<br />
No comfort, no solace, no prayer.</p>
<p>Trembling and shaken, she moved on,<br />
A life haunted by what had gone.<br />
Haunted by shadows in the night,<br />
Fearful to hope and lost her sight.</p>
<p>What was it that broke her trust?<br />
Was it the deafness that held her in disgust?<br />
Or was it the goodness that never shone through,<br />
Leaving behind nothing but fear anew.</p>
<p>Burdens too heavy, pains too much,<br />
These are the things that have left her in such,<br />
A wounded soul and frightened spirit,<br />
Where hope once dwelled but now cannot bear it.</p>
<p>It's easy to ask what could be worse,<br />
But nothing compares to this kind of curse,<br />
When she was abused, her trust gone away;<br />
With everything else, pain just stays.</p>
<p>Faith shakes, heart breaks,<br />
She wonders if anyone even cares,<br />
She howls at the moon but silence prevails,<br />
A life of doubt - this is the tale.</p>
<p>Memories flood, nightmares surprise,<br />
Every moment brings distressful cries,<br />
Trapped within the past, yet present remains,<br />
Her mind and body are in shackles, in chains.</p>
<p>The questions haunt her day and night,<br />
Why did it happen? Who was right?<br />
Countless battles fought and lost,<br />
Crushed, shattered and forever tossed.</p>
<p>Caught in a vortex, spiralling down,<br />
Her screams muffled by the ones around,<br />
The fear of another assault is real<br />
Lost in her wounds that never heal.</p>
<p>How much pain can one heart bear?<br />
How much sorrow can one soul share?<br />
So much, it tears the world apart,<br />
Leaving behind just a broken heart.</p>
<p>Crying out to God, but no reply,<br />
No helping hand to hold her high,<br />
Still lost in her memories and tears,<br />
Wishing to have someone to calm her fears.</p>
<p>She calls upon the heavens up above,<br />
Seeking everlasting love,<br />
Perplexed to find nothing to believe,<br />
Thereâ€™s nothing that could relieve.</p>
<p>Life once filled with love and light,<br />
Now dimmed with horrors and shadows of night,<br />
Betrayed, abandoned and left alone,<br />
She awaits for faith to become known.</p>
<p>Broken soul, scarred beyond repair,<br />
Her heart still bleeds, still stirs there.<br />
Insecurity beyond words is right,<br />
Living in fear with a lost fight.</p>
<p>She now walks in shadows, avoids the light,<br />
Afraid of losing again; it's simple but right.<br />
Every step a torment, every breath uncertain,<br />
Her future bleak, her hope, desertion.</p>
<p>The tale may end, but fear remains,<br />
Wounded hearts are slow to heal,<br />
Time can cure, perhaps in years to come,<br />
Till then, the girl remains undone.</p>
<p>Though her trust in God may be no more,<br />
She found the strength to rise and restore.<br />
Her scars may never fully disappear,<br />
But her spirit is stronger than ever, clear.</p>
<p>She lost her trust in God,<br />
Her faith stolen, her heart flawed.<br />
Raped and helpless, she cried,<br />
But salvation never arrived.</p>
<p>She prayed to her God so much,<br />
The pain intense, it hurt as such.<br />
But all her pleas fell on deaf ears,<br />
Pierced her soul with dreadful fears.</p>
<p>Once in love with her divine,<br />
Now lost, betrayed, and resigned.<br />
Faithless, wandering in dim light,<br />
Trapped in a state of endless fright.</p>
<p>She hungers for some sure hope,<br />
A lifeline to pull her from the slope.<br />
But all she knows is fear and doubt,<br />
Wounded from in and out.</p>
<p>Her sense of security detonates,<br />
A shivering mass of doubts and hates.<br />
In a world where faith cannot heal,<br />
She bleeds and crumbles, her soul to steal.</p>
<p>Shadows lurk in every corner,<br />
Haunting her like a vengeful mourner.<br />
Pain echoes round her twisted fate,<br />
Mourns the God she thought was great.</p>
<p>Every wound and shame she feels,<br />
Blazes with some devouring zeal.<br />
Her heartbroken and filled with dread,<br />
And painful experience ever since she bled.</p>
<p>Her soul savaged by malevolence,<br />
Jaded by the grudge and the conscience.<br />
Who can she turn to in her demise</p>
<p>Who can satisfy her longing eyes?</p>
<p>Her dreams of purity long gone,<br />
Her hopes shattered and withdrawn.<br />
Confiding to no one, too afraid to trust,<br />
Wants no pity or sympathy, for it is shallow and unjust.</p>
<p>She's a prisoner of the night,<br />
Where darkness reigns with gleeful delight,<br />
A victim in a world of beasts,<br />
Where pleasure is served by some feasts.</p>
<p>The demons in her head,<br />
Haunt her every step as she treads.<br />
Her soul a battleground of woe,<br />
With nothing but hate to show.</p>
<p>Unforgiving nemesis of life,<br />
Plots horror against her vibrant mind,<br />
A misery becomes a lifelong strife<br />
That leaves bitter taste behind.</p>
<p>Her spirit sinks deeper in distress,<br />
A soul lost in an endless mess<br />
Of sullenness and hopelessness,<br />
Trapped in a web of helplessness.</p>
<p>Crying rivers for what was taken,<br />
Her existence exposed, her heart shaken.<br />
A once-trusting heart now shattered,<br />
Left with anger boiling in anger.</p>
<p>Fury won't untrammel her emotion,<br />
Nor pain will stop her commotion,<br />
Confused about why this violence he loaded,<br />
Bereft of God, she feels alone &amp; floated.</p>
<p>How to heal wounds that never end?</p>
<p>Who can help her fall and ascend?<br />
As broken as she is,<br />
In the silence she grants herself a new lease.</p>
<p>She seeks love that can still beat,<br />
Yet desbottoned by the trauma that repeats,<br />
Her forever changed and tormented soul,<br />
Stigmatised by the burden of that toll.</p>
<p>A girl helpless, a story sad,<br />
Lost faith in God, which she once had.<br />
Would she ever regain what was lost?<br />
The mere thought brings her in exhaust.</p>
<p>Her life a painful maze,<br />
Haunted by unspeakable malaise.<br />
But deep within her, a gentle fire,<br />
Burning hope in the midst of her dire.</p>
<p>Her soul is not as dead,<br />
As it seems when it bows its head.<br />
Healing takes time, a slow journey,<br />
But with every step, she finds her energy.</p>
<p>Forgetting entirely the past she can't,<br />
Moving on her only chance for a grant,<br />
A strength lies within her that she has to tap,<br />
To push through the barriers and quench her insatiable chaps.</p>
<p>She triumphs, the girl so strong,<br />
Wounded but never did belong.<br />
She deflected the darkness that trailed,<br />
Withstanding the chaos in every detail.</p>
<p>From the ashes of fear &amp; insecurity,<br />
A queen arose - blooming with maturity.<br />
Challenging evil face to face,<br />
Refusing to be a victim or a disgrace.</p>
<p>The world has not yet understood her plight,<br />
The pain that hidden - her incessant fight.<br />
But her scars, merely ink on her skin,<br />
One day, it'll be meaningful like a loving validation.</p>
<p>No longer trapped in a chasm so deep,<br />
The girl is now prepared to leap<br />
Into a world rich with love and light,<br />
Resilient spirit, in flight.</p>
<p>A journey that's just begun -<br />
To restore what was lost then won,<br />
A purpose newfound, so bright,<br />
A story worth looking in delight.</p>
<p>In life, there are trials to face,<br />
A prismatic hue of diverse grace.<br />
But through every hurt and wound,<br />
There are achievements so profound.</p>
<p>It may take a while to heal,<br />
But eventually, she'll find her seal.<br />
Perfection impossible to attain,<br />
Hope remains an infinite gain.</p>
<p>So let us sing a song of hope,<br />
A melody to help her cope.<br />
Let our voices join to uplift,<br />
Wrap our arms around her and gift.</p>
<p>For she is not alone in her plight,<br />
Her destiny now back in sight.<br />
Faith never faileth her,<br />
Her soul, mightier than her hinderer.</p>
<p>The past has gone, a fresh start awaits,<br />
A brand-new chapter in life she creates.<br />
One of love, joy, and hope,<br />
With God or without him, limitless rope.</p>
<p>Now, a flower in bloom<br />
No more feeling invisible in the room.<br />
Life will be kind again,<br />
The sun will shine &amp; remove every stain.</p>
<p>For in the end, it's only strength that lives,<br />
Ingrained in a heart that forgives,<br />
So look ahead, young girl, keep striving,<br />
And keep an open heart from upsurging.</p>
<p>For every heartache and woe,<br />
There's a silver lining to show.<br />
Believe that healing is in sight,<br />
And everything will be alright.</p>
<p>It's true that some scars remain,<br />
But what makes us strong is accepting the pain.<br />
So be brave and take the next step,<br />
In life, love and faithfulness, wrap with prep.</p>
<p>May her spirit soar high,<br />
Her heart happy, no longer cry.<br />
May her life filled with brightness,<br />
Her faith now sown with righteousness.</p>
<p>The girl may have lost trust in God,<br />
But through love, she reclaims her unearthed bod.<br />
With each race that others deem lost,<br />
In her victory, she finds a cause.</p>
<p>Now, despite every obstacle and plight,<br />
The young girl never loses sight.<br />
For beyond the shadows' looming reach,<br />
Faith that triumphs over everything- once breach.</p>
<p>Elevating past clouds in the sky<br />
A spirit soaring on its own high.<br />
Lyrics to God now speak,<br />
For victory was won, and the future is meek.</p>
<p>Forgiveness &amp; strength in every view,<br />
A purpose for the vindicated few.<br />
Life has meaning beyond the pain,<br />
And she can now look ahead with a new gain.</p>
<p>In the end, let good intentions remain,<br />
A hope to heal every ounce of pain.<br />
So be strong and hold on tight,<br />
And follow the stars that still shine bright.</p>
<p>May each tear now turn into strength,<br />
Her struggles a measure of what it takes.<br />
For in life deepest cuts indeed,<br />
We find our strength, love and lead.</p>
<p>And though there are nights so tough,<br />
Where pain crawls in her breath, almost enough,<br />
Let faith find a way to her heart,<br />
And she'll make it to the sweetest part.<br />
though God may seem ever silent,<br />
The spirits of time will never relent,<br />
Faith finds its way through pain,<br />
And she can rise again, no matter how tired remain.</p>
<p>As the world replaces what was stolen,<br />
Within her a hope forever swollen,<br />
A better day dawns on her with love,<br />
Gifting her an eternal happiness bliss of.</p>
<p>She was so lost, so all alone,<br />
Her trust in others, forever gone.<br />
And though she wished to scream and shout,<br />
No words could ever let it out.</p>
<p>For she was nothing, but a shell,<br />
A hollow creature, trapped in hell.<br />
The world had stolen all she had,<br />
And left her feeling oh so sad.</p>
<p>In every shadow, she saw a threat,<br />
And every step was filled with regret.<br />
For what had happened, changed her fate,<br />
And left her in a never-ending state.</p>
<p>Of heartbreak, pain, and grief untold,<br />
Of dreams she lost, and hearts grown cold.<br />
And yet, through all the dark and night,<br />
There came a glimmer of hope, so bright.</p>
<p>For she found strength within her soul,<br />
A force so mighty, it made her whole.<br />
And though her scars would always stay,<br />
She learned to live and love each day.</p>
<p>And so, she rose above the hate,<br />
And found a new, and better fate.<br />
Through all the pain, she found her worth,<br />
A shining star that lit the earth.</p>
<p>For love and kindness, they will show,<br />
The path to hope, and a brighter tomorrow.</p>
