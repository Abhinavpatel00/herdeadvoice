            <h1>Her Debilitated Innocence</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Her heart, once pure and trusting,<br />
Was broken by a love so unjustly.<br />
Her secrets now revealed, her fear growing,<br />
Her studies halted, her dreams lost.</p>
<p>Her heart shattered as her love betrayed,<br />
Her moments, once private, now displayed.<br />
Her studies stopped, fear consumed her soul,<br />
And her pain left her feeling far from whole.</p>
<p>Fear consumed her, her studies came to a halt,<br />
As she struggled to regain what she once sought.<br />
A relative offered a chance to study and grow,<br />
But little did she know, it was a trap, a toxic show.</p>
<p>Her own kin, the ones she trusted, blackmailed her so,<br />
Threatening to hurt her sister, it was a cruel blow.<br />
Against her will, they raped her, destroying her trust,<br />
It seemed like a never ending cycle of unjust.</p>
<p>She thought work would bring an escape, a new start,<br />
But again, she was met with cruelty, tearing her apart.<br />
Her boss saw her as inferior, just a tool to use,<br />
Raped in the elevator, to move forward, she had to lose.</p>
<p>Called to the cabin, told to submit to him,<br />
Her body was a commodity, it all seemed so grim.<br />
A life that once had dreams and aspirations,<br />
Now consumed by pain, violence, and frustrations.</p>
<p>Oh, the plight of the girl, in a society so unjust,<br />
Where she's merely an object, to be used and thrust.<br />
Betrayed by love, by family, by work, by all she knew,<br />
Her spirit may be broken, but her courage will renew.</p>
<p>Let us raise our voice, for the girl's rights to be heard,<br />
To stop the cycle of violence, so she can soar like a bird.<br />
May her struggles never be in vain, may her voice be strong,<br />
For we will fight beside her, till justice is served, till the wrong is gone.</p>
