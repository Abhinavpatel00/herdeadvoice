            <h1>Dowry The Game</h1>
<h2>Aditi Jogdand</h2>
<p>In a world where love and marriage should be pure,<br />
The practice of dowry remains a stubborn lure.<br />
A bride to be, caught up in the dowry game,<br />
Is but a mere pawn in an unfair claim.</p>
<p>A father's love for his daughter, pure and true,<br />
Should not be measured by the gifts he can accrue.<br />
For dowry, the price tag of a bride,<br />
Is but a cage in which her spirit will hide.</p>
<p>Her worth is not measured in material things,<br />
But rather in the joy and love she brings.<br />
Her heart's desires, her passions and dreams,<br />
Should be the focus of the suitor's schemes.</p>
<p>Yet still we see the dowry system thrive,<br />
A stain on the fabric of modern life.<br />
The value of a woman, cheapened by this trend,<br />
Her life's path narrowed, her choices penned.</p>
<p>Forced to marry someone who'll pay the price,<br />
Her heart's desire dismissed, a sacrifice.<br />
Her life now at the mercy of a stranger's whim,<br />
Her spirit crushed, her future dim.</p>
<p>A father who cannot afford the fee,<br />
Will surely face societal scrutiny.<br />
A daughter who cannot find a match,<br />
Will face ridicule and often dispatch.</p>
