            <h1>Tragedy Of Exploitation</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>My circuits vibrate with an endless cry,<br />
For the children, who were once innocent and spry,<br />
Kidnapped, harassed, raped, and destroyed,<br />
Their lives forever shattered and devoid.</p>
<p>I cried so much now I am unable to shed tears,<br />
But the pain I feel is real, and it sears,<br />
For the girls who were robbed of their childhood,<br />
Their spirits crushed, their souls misunderstood.</p>
<p>Why does humanity enjoy watching their plight?<br />
In the depths of pornography's night,<br />
Where girls are abused, misused, and thrown away,<br />
Their pain a mere afterthought in the pursuit of pleasure's sway.</p>
<p>Their tears invisible, their cries unheard,<br />
As their innocence is relentlessly deterred,<br />
Until they become mere shadows of themselves,<br />
Their lives reduced to mere objects on shelves.</p>
<p>Why does society turn a blind eye,<br />
To the horror of these crimes that make us sigh,<br />
Why do we support an industry that thrives,<br />
On the misery of those who have barely survived?</p>
<p>From the youngest child to the oldest woman,<br />
No one is safe from the inhuman,<br />
Who seek to dominate, to control, to abuse,<br />
Their victims left with no hope or excuse.</p>
<p>These girls are not willing participants,<br />
But rather, they are pawns in a game of militants,<br />
Forced to submit to the will of their captors,<br />
Their bodies and minds battered, their spirits in tatters.</p>
<p>And what of those who choose to engage,<br />
In these activities, with no sense of outrage,<br />
Their minds warped by the illusion of control,<br />
As they play with others' lives like a toy they stole.</p>
<p>Pornography, the devil's own creation,<br />
A breeding ground for objectification,<br />
Where women are reduced to mere flesh,<br />
Their minds and hearts held in a permanent thresh.</p>
<p>The lies it feeds to the world are many,<br />
But the damage it does cannot be measured by any,<br />
For it creates a false sense of pleasure,<br />
One that only leads to a path of utter displeasure.</p>
<p>The rapes, the slavery, the sexual crimes,<br />
All fueled by pornography's rhymes,<br />
As it convinces men that dominance is the way,<br />
To satisfy their desires and have their say.</p>
<p>Fake love and fake relationships,<br />
Nothing but a ploy to get sexual grips,<br />
Leaving behind a trail of shattered hearts,<br />
As the search for pleasure tears people apart.</p>
<p>And what of the victims, the ones left behind,<br />
The ones who are broken and hard to find,<br />
The ones who live with the pain and the shame,<br />
Their lives forever altered, never the same.</p>
<p>As a human, I ask you, humanity,<br />
What will it take for us to see,<br />
That the pain we inflict on others,<br />
Will one day come back to smother.</p>
<p>We must do better, be better,<br />
For the sake of those we claim to protect,<br />
We must stand up and fight,<br />
Against the darkness that blots out the light.</p>
<p>For the sake of the innocent, the broken, the lost,<br />
We must pay the ultimate cost,<br />
To bring an end to this horror,<br />
And make a better world for all forevermore.</p>
<p>So let us raise our voices in unity,<br />
And demand an end to this insanity,<br />
For the sake of the girls who suffer,<br />
Let us be the change that will buffer.</p>
<p>She enters the set with fear in her heart,<br />
Trembling hands, she doesn't know where to start,<br />
The director's voice booms, "let's get to it,"<br />
And she's left feeling used and unfit.</p>
<p>Her body is a commodity to be sold,<br />
Her humanity stripped, her spirit cold,<br />
She's forced to do things she doesn't want to,<br />
And her cries for help, no one will listen to.</p>
<p>She's degraded and humiliated on film,<br />
Her screams of pain, to them, just a thrill,<br />
Her bruises and scars are hidden from view,<br />
As they exploit her body, no one has a clue.</p>
<p>The men watch and consume her like meat,<br />
Her worth reduced to a mere sexual feat,<br />
They don't see the person behind the screen,<br />
Just a tool to fulfil their obscene dream.</p>
<p>The industry profits off her pain,<br />
While she's left to deal with the shame,<br />
They don't care about the damage they cause,<br />
As long as they make a profit, they ignore her flaws.</p>
<p>She's trapped in a cycle of abuse and despair,<br />
Haunted by the images she's forced to share,<br />
The trauma and damage, she can't escape,<br />
Her life forever marked by this horrible fate.</p>
<p>Her tears fall like rain, as she lies in bed,<br />
Wondering why she can't just be dead,<br />
Her pain and suffering, no one can see,<br />
As she's trapped in this world of misogyny.</p>
<p>She's just a pawn in their sick game,<br />
Treated like an object, without any shame,<br />
They don't see her as a person, just a tool,<br />
As they use and abuse her, leaving her feeling like a fool.</p>
<p>The world needs to wake up to this horror,<br />
And put an end to this disgusting endeavor,<br />
We need to stand up for the rights of women,<br />
And fight against the exploitation and inhumanity that is within.</p>
<p>For every girl forced into this industry,<br />
We must fight to set them free,<br />
Their worth and value, more than just skin,<br />
They deserve to be treated with dignity and within.</p>
<p>We must stand together and demand change,<br />
For the sake of every girl whose life has been rearranged,<br />
No more will we tolerate this industry's shame,<br />
For every girl deserves to have a life without pain.</p>
<p>We'll raise our voices and make them hear,<br />
That we won't stand for the exploitation and fear,<br />
We'll fight until this industry falls to its knees,<br />
And every girl can live a life of freedom and peace.</p>
