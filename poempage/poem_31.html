            <h1>Her concealed wounds</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Her cries are still untold,<br />
And her heart so cold,<br />
She's breathing but not air,<br />
Broken soul and anxiety, what a mispair!</p>
<p>Smile , laugh were already snatched,<br />
Those monstrous acts and expressions she watched.<br />
Emotionlessness grabbed her soul deep inside filled with dark;<br />
But each pain , memory were sharp,</p>
<p>What she did to be in this state ?<br />
As you all said no , she was never late.</p>
<p>Her voice full of deep sorrow and heart full of scars ,<br />
She is also human,Why did she got those marks ?</p>
<p>Her injuries are now deadly rain ;<br />
Which not visible dont even pain.</p>
<p>The shine of sun is the darkest night;<br />
But she seems normal to eye sight.</p>
<p>The black of complete silence is still unseen,<br />
Why don't you hear her carefully ? She isn't a machine !</p>
