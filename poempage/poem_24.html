            <h1>Love Language Of humanity</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>In love's embrace, a higher force,<br />
That binds two souls in its pure course,<br />
With every breath, with every kiss,<br />
A union formed, in timeless bliss.</p>
<p>But when the force is one of power,<br />
And love is stripped of its sweet flower,<br />
What's left is but a hollow shell,<br />
Of agony and endless hell.</p>
<p>To force oneself on one's own spouse,<br />
Is to rob them of their very house,<br />
Of dignity and self respect,<br />
And leave them feeling so abject.</p>
<p>For love is not just physical,<br />
It's spiritual and magical,<br />
And when we seek to dominate,<br />
We seal our own unhappy fate.</p>
<p>Let's cherish those we love and hold,<br />
With tenderness and hearts so bold,<br />
For in that love, we find our peace,<br />
And all our doubts and fears are released.</p>
<p>For only then can we truly see,<br />
The beauty of love's majesty<br />
Love, a word so pure and divine<br />
Yet humans distort it, commit a crime<br />
Forcing themselves on their beloved spouse<br />
To fulfill desires, they cannot arouse</p>
<p>Lust and pleasure, they seek to gain<br />
Ignoring their partner's hurt and pain<br />
Forgetting the bond they once shared<br />
Leaving their love and respect impaired</p>
