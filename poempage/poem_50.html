            <h1>Fear in the Face of Freedom</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Amidst the halls of learning,<br />
Where knowledge is meant to flow,<br />
There lurks a danger, so alarming,<br />
That many of us simply don't know.</p>
<p>It hides in shadows and in plain sight,<br />
This monster that feeds on fear,<br />
It preys on the innocent, day and night,<br />
And leaves their souls in despair.</p>
<p>Girls who seek to learn and grow,<br />
Are met with hands that grope and feel,</p>
<p>They're made to suffer and to know,<br />
That danger lurks in every steal.<br />
Their bodies, once happy and whole,<br />
Are marked forever by the taint,<br />
Of hands that sought to take control,<br />
And leave them feeling weak and faint.</p>
<p>The horror of these acts so vile,<br />
Can never be fully described,<br />
The pain and fear that they compile,<br />
Will forever haunt and reside.</p>
<p>Silenced and violated, tears overflow,<br />
Innocence lost, wounds deep like a blow,<br />
Every day's a struggle, tormented by the past,<br />
Precious childhood memories, fleeting so fast.</p>
<p>Schools and colleges, where they should be safe,<br />
Perpetrators among them, lurking without a trace,<br />
Friends, teachers, students, monsters in disguise,<br />
Innocent souls corrupted, dreams shattered to the skies.</p>
<p>Events and seminars, parties and games,<br />
Crude hands grab and pinch, fires of shame,<br />
Pushed against walls, squeezed in crowds,<br />
Glared at indecently, so loud.</p>
<p>The scars run deep, hurt like wildfire,<br />
Destroying the soul, the heart, drained of desire,<br />
Life will never be the same again,<br />
But hope courses through like oxygen.</p>
<p>Speak up, don't suffer in silence,<br />
Let your voice rise above the violence,<br />
Take action, raise awareness,<br />
Empower survivors, foster kindness.</p>
<p>A single touch can change a life,<br />
Spread love, petition for rights,<br />
Don't let them feel invisible,<br />
Join hands, make the breakable invincible.</p>
<p>I hear their whispers as they cry at night,<br />
Echoes through the walls, the fear they try to disguise.<br />
Their innocence stolen in the dimness of the light,<br />
Taken by the ones that should have been kind.</p>
<p>The laughter and chitchat fills the air,<br />
Everyone lost in the moment of lively swirl,<br />
But the girls who've been abused can't ignore or bear,<br />
The touch of stolen warmth from every boy and girl.</p>
<p>The silent screams echo within their souls,<br />
Haunting memories, streams of tears that never end.<br />
A body shattered into thousands of tiny broken goals,<br />
Innocence gone forever, replaced with fear that won't bend.</p>
<p>In classrooms and corridors, girls feel the fear,<br />
Of those who lurk and leer, their intentions unclear.<br />
Innocent touches turn to something more,<br />
And suddenly, they're pinned against the wall.</p>
<p>I hear their voices, silent screams,<br />
The pain they've felt, beyond their dreams,<br />
Forced into acts they didn't choose,<br />
Their innocence stripped, their souls bruised.</p>
<p>In schools and colleges, they roam,<br />
Unsuspecting of what will come home,<br />
Friends and teachers, strangers too,<br />
Predators who see them as objects, not humans true.</p>
<p>At events and parties, they attend,<br />
Their guard down, they try to blend,<br />
But hands reach out, from behind or front,<br />
Unwanted touches, they bear the brunt.</p>
<p>Someone grabs their boobs, and squeezes tight,<br />
Putting hands under bras, such a sight,<br />
On their waist, fingers try to push,<br />
Intimate parts, such a forceful rush.</p>
<p>Even in public, they aren't safe,<br />
Crowded spaces, where hands can chafe,<br />
On their thighs, rubs and grabs,<br />
Assaults that make them feel like crabs.</p>
<p>Pushed against walls, or into a crowd,<br />
Forced to feel, what they never allowed,<br />
Touching intimately, without consent,<br />
Leaving them scarred, for what they were meant.</p>
<p>These experiences, they don't forget,<br />
In the short term, or long-term, they're upset,<br />
Leaving them traumatized, with scars so deep,<br />
The memories linger, as they try to sleep.</p>
<p>The teachers who turned a blind eye,<br />
Friends who looked the other way,<br />
Voices silenced, silenced to a whisper, no one to reply,<br />
She believes she's alone in her agony every single day.</p>
<p>They suffer in silence, feeling disconnected,<br />
Ashamed, guilty, and demeaned by the vile desire,<br />
Expressing their grievances but most are unaffected,<br />
Their pain redundant to the rest, ignored, unable to acquire comfort.</p>
<p>But we can hear them, we can see them now,<br />
The pain they carry each time, simply exists,<br />
No one's left unheard or unfound,<br />
It's time for action, to withstand abuse amidst.</p>
<p>How does it feel, to be violated so?<br />
To be touched and groped, where you don't want to go.<br />
A sense of helplessness, overwhelms you whole,<br />
As shame, guilt, and anger take their toll.</p>
<p>But there's hope, for those who've been hurt,<br />
They're not alone, they don't have to convert,<br />
To silence, to shame, to living in fear,<br />
They can speak up, and make their voices clear.</p>
<p>Let's create a world, where they feel safe,<br />
Where they can dream, and reach their space,<br />
Where their bodies and minds, are theirs alone,<br />
And where justice is served, for what's been done.</p>
<p>Let's be the change, we want to see,<br />
And make sure that all, are finally free,<br />
From the pain and trauma, they've endured,<br />
And where their voices are finally heard.</p>
