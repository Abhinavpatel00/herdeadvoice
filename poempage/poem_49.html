            <h1>Silent Scars that Speak</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>In the dark corners of the human mind,<br />
Lurks a perverse pleasure in violent views we find.<br />
When pain and abuse are created beyond measure,<br />
The bonds of love and faith become a poisonous treasure.</p>
<p>This toxic rope tightens around the throat,<br />
Killing hope and leaving dreams afloat.<br />
The eyes of the abuser gleam with sick intentions,<br />
Their terrible invention causes untold dimensions.</p>
<p>Though once a different man, now consumed by the same<br />
Feelings of thrill intensify and life becomes a game.<br />
The heart forgets all but the desire to kill,<br />
The wife and daughter no longer feel the thrill.<br />
The child bride married without a choice,<br />
Protectors become predators, leaving her voice so coy.<br />
Her once bright future turns black,<br />
She becomes a toy bird, her soul under attack.</p>
<p>Her mind a broken shelf, a writer of a tragic tale,<br />
Struggling to keep her voice low, her courage about to fail.<br />
Words like a sharp knife cut through her heart,<br />
Physical wounds and scars tearing her apart.</p>
<p>Stability of mind lost, trapped in an endless hell,<br />
Suffering with no cost, her story hard to tell.<br />
Her body just a home for disease,<br />
Her beauty of soul, impossible to seize.</p>
<p>Lost and failed in this life,<br />
Her broken pieces of heart, hard to strive.<br />
But within the darkness, a glimmer of hope shines,<br />
Her courage and strength, never to resign.</p>
<p>The path to healing is long and hard,<br />
But with each step, a victory card.<br />
The scars may never fully heal,<br />
But the light within her soul, will never yield.</p>
<p>For every tragedy and every pain,<br />
She will find a way to rise again.<br />
A testament to the human spirit and its power,<br />
A beacon of hope in the darkest hour.</p>
<p>She walks in the shadows, unnoticed and unseen<br />
A woman, a girl, a victim of a machine<br />
A machine built on power, on control, on lust<br />
A machine that strips her of her dignity and trust</p>
<p>She was taught to be quiet, to never make a sound<br />
To accept the pain, the shame, and never turn around<br />
To keep her head down, and hide her bruises and scars<br />
To be a silent witness to the cruelty of men’s wars</p>
<p>She was told that she’s weak, that she can’t fight back<br />
That her body is theirs, a possession to attack<br />
That she deserves it, that she’s the one to blame<br />
That her voice is worthless, that her life is a game</p>
<p>But she’s not just a body, a toy, a slave<br />
She’s a human being, with a soul, with a brave<br />
She’s a survivor, a fighter, a force to be reckoned<br />
A woman who refuses to be silenced or broken</p>
<p>She rises from the ashes, like a phoenix in flight<br />
With a voice that’s louder, with a will to fight<br />
She stands up to her abuser, to the system that failed<br />
To the culture that taught her to be weak and pale</p>
<p>She demands justice, respect, and equality<br />
She challenges the norms, the rules, the authority<br />
She refuses to be a victim, a statistic, a name<br />
She chooses to be a survivor, a warrior, a flame</p>
<p>She finds support, love, and hope in her sisters<br />
In the women who share her pain, her fears, her blisters<br />
In the allies who stand by her side, who believe in her cause<br />
Who fight with her, for her, against the invisible claws</p>
<p>She rebuilds her life, one step at a time<br />
With the scars that remind her of the mountain she climbed</p>
<p>With the memories that haunt her, but no longer define<br />
With the dreams that inspire her, the future that shines</p>
<p>She became a toy, a bird whose wings were clipped,<br />
Her mind became a broken shelf, and her spirit was stripped.<br />
The writer of her story forgot herself, lost in her own pain,<br />
She struggled to remain silent, even though speaking out could have<br />
saved her life, in vain.</p>
