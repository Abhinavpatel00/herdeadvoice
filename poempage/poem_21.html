            <h1>Muted Voices, Stolen Dreams</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Abhinav, a philosopher and thinker,<br />
In India, he dwelled, seeking to uncover<br />
The truth behind the trials of women,<br />
And the injustices they face, one after another.</p>
<p>He saw the pain of dowry, a burden to bear,<br />
A price to be paid for a daughter to wed,<br />
A cycle of debt, oppression, and despair,<br />
That kept women under society's tread.</p>
<p>But even beyond this, a more heinous crime,<br />
Forced marriage, a horror that he could not condone,<br />
Girls robbed of their youth, of their freedom and time,<br />
Their futures sealed, before they have even grown.</p>
<p>Abhinav saw the shackles of tradition,<br />
The weight of customs and ancient norms,<br />
That kept women in a state of submission,<br />
Their dreams and desires considered lesser forms.</p>
<p>He saw the fear in their eyes, the pain in their hearts,<br />
The hopelessness that engulfed them like a shroud,<br />
As they were stripped of their agency, their essential parts,<br />
Treated like property, disallowed to be proud.</p>
<p>But Abhinav did not simply observe and despair,<br />
He spoke out against the oppression of girls and women,<br />
He called for change, for a world that is fair,<br />
Where every person's worth is considered a given.</p>
<p>Abhinav, with a heavy heart,<br />
Sees the suffering of these girls, torn apart,<br />
And so, he speaks out against this cruel fate,<br />
Demanding change, before it's too late.</p>
<p>He called for education, for opportunities,<br />
For girls to be treated as equals and more,<br />
To be allowed to thrive and fulfil their destinies,<br />
To be valued for their minds, their talents, their core.</p>
<p>And though the road is long, the journey fraught with strife,<br />
Abhinav remained committed to the cause,<br />
He would not give up, not while there was still life,<br />
For he knew that true change would only come from his pause.</p>
<p>So let us all take up this banner, this call to arms,<br />
To fight for the rights of girls and women, to make their voices heard,<br />
For the time is now, to end all these harms,<br />
And create a world where every person is valued, cherished, and revered.</p>
<p>In a world of ancient customs and traditions,<br />
There exists a practice that defies all reason,<br />
A bond that's formed without consent or volition,<br />
A forced marriage, a union without passion.</p>
<p>Girls are often the ones who bear the brunt,<br />
Of this archaic custom, this barbaric stunt,<br />
Forced into a life they never chose,<br />
Their dreams and aspirations forever froze.</p>
<p>Their fate is decided without their say,<br />
Their hearts and minds forced to obey,<br />
Their lives forever altered and changed,<br />
In a world where their voices are estranged.</p>
<p>The love they seek is deemed unnecessary,<br />
Their desires and wishes viewed as secondary,<br />
Their worth measured in their domesticity,<br />
Their dreams of education and freedom, mere frivolity.</p>
<p>Forced into a marriage they never wanted,<br />
Their souls and spirits forever haunted,<br />
By the injustice of their stolen fate,<br />
By the loss of their autonomy, the cost of their state.</p>
<p>Their identities stripped, their agency taken,<br />
Their potential squandered, their will forsaken,<br />
Trapped in a life they never chose,<br />
Their souls forever scarred, their hearts never close.</p>
<p>Forced marriages of girls, a practice so archaic,<br />
A societal ill, a custom so tragic,<br />
A violation of human rights, a crime against humanity,<br />
A blight on our world, a stain on our dignity.</p>
<p>Forced marriages of girls, a tragedy so real,<br />
Let us work together, let us heal,<br />
A world that's broken, a world that needs repair,<br />
Let us build a world, where every girl is free and fair.</p>
