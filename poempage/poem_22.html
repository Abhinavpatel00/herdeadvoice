            <h1>A Cry for Freedom</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Oh, the weight of her burden, so heavy to bear,<br />
The scars and the pain, the constant despair,<br />
The feeling of worthlessness, the struggle to survive,<br />
The fear that engulfs her, the wish to not be alive.</p>
<p>Her heart aches with every breath that she takes,<br />
As the memories flood in, and the pain awakes,<br />
The bruises and the cuts, the wounds that won't heal,<br />
The trauma that lingers, the torment she feels.</p>
<p>She wonders if she'll ever be free from this pain,<br />
If she'll ever be able to break from this chain,<br />
If there'll ever be a day when she can smile,<br />
When she can breathe with ease, and rest for a while.</p>
<p>But hope seems so far away, like a distant dream,<br />
As she struggles to escape, from this endless stream,<br />
Of violence and abuse, of horror and pain,<br />
Of a life that she didn't choose, but was forced to sustain.</p>
<p>Yet, in the depths of her despair, a flicker of light,<br />
A glimmer of hope, that shines so bright,<br />
A strength that rises, a spirit that soars,<br />
A will to survive, that refuses to be torn.</p>
<p>For she knows deep down, that she is not alone,<br />
That there are others who stand with her, who have shown,<br />
That there is a way out, that there is a path,<br />
To a life that's worth living, to a future that's bright.</p>
<p>So she takes a deep breath, and finds the strength within,<br />
To rise up and fight, to break from this sin,<br />
To reclaim her life, to find her way,<br />
To a world that's safe, where she can stay.</p>
<p>For she knows that she deserves to live,<br />
To be happy, to be free, to receive,<br />
Love and kindness, and a life that's true,<br />
To be herself, and not just make it through.</p>
<p>And so she takes another step, and another,<br />
Towards a life that's full, and a future that's brighter,<br />
Towards a world where no one will have to feel,<br />
Like they don't deserve to breathe, or to heal.</p>
