            <h1>A Box of Buried Memories</h1>
<h2>Aditi Jogdand</h2>
<p>Each day self blame is the accessory she wore<br />
She isn't dead not alive , at the shore<br />
Each day ended with juvenile wounds<br />
and rosen with numb sound</p>
<p>The marks he gave weren't the less ;<br />
that she got injuries by those she faced<br />
Her life , dreams became extinct mess<br />
Her thoughts becoming just a box of buried dead body<br />
But her sufferings still unknown to everybody</p>
<p>She is tired of those fake smiles as a face mask<br />
Why need to always answer all fine when they ask<br />
Her hopes became burden of her longtime<br />
words always stayed the same to rhyme<br />
But she is tired of it , to be honest<br />
She can't pretend anymore to be the best</p>
<p>It has been a long time , but she isn't cured<br />
The pain still engulfs her soul inside<br />
In the crowd around her side<br />
the strange and heart tearing presence she still finds</p>
<p>Eyes turned red with cry each night<br />
But in morning nothing was visible sight<br />
She is tired of continuing this hurting fight<br />
Okay fine , you are right ;<br />
But kind justice keepers please don't tag ;</p>
<p>Her to be wrong and her pain a lie<br />
Time didnt had that power to fade her memories<br />
Though society forced her to pretend to be alright<br />
Otherwise she'll be again buried with the same kind of wounds , she<br />
unable to fight</p>
<p>This isn't a fairytale she told to entertain<br />
Its reminder for us to retain ;<br />
Her dignity and her respect<br />
Which is her right , do not suspect</p>
