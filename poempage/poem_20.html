            <h1>Be The Wise Change</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>In this world, so vast and wide<br />
There are those who can't hide<br />
From the eyes that follow their every move<br />
And the hands that invade their groove</p>
<p>These girls, so innocent and pure<br />
Are subject to a world so obscure<br />
Where stalkers lurk in every corner<br />
And their peace of mind they must barter</p>
<p>In a world where power reigns supreme,<br />
The innocent are prey to a sinister scheme.<br />
Girls, vulnerable and pure of heart,<br />
Are subject to society's oppressive art.</p>
<p>Stalkers lurk in every corner,<br />
Their lecherous gaze like a foreigner,<br />
Invading the privacy of a girl's mind,<br />
Leaving behind scars, hard to unwind.</p>
<p>In a society that glorifies masculinity,<br />
Girls are made to feel like a liability.<br />
Their intelligence, their achievements, all ignored,<br />
Their worth measured by their beauty, adored.</p>
<p>They are told to dress modestly, stay inside,<br />
And yet, they are blamed if they are assaulted, defied.<br />
Their freedom curtailed, their choices denied,<br />
Their lives controlled, their hopes denied.</p>
<p>It's time for us to wake up and see,<br />
That a girl's life deserves to be free.<br />
Let's build a world where girls can thrive,<br />
Where their dreams are realized, and they can come alive.</p>
<p>Innocent hearts, pure and young,<br />
Their fate decided before they've sprung,<br />
Forced into unions they don't desire,<br />
Their dreams and hopes now set on fire.</p>
<p>In the depths of the human soul,<br />
Lies a darkness we cannot control,<br />
A force that seeks to dominate,<br />
And dictate the fates of those we hate.</p>
<p>To be married against one's will,<br />
Is a fate too cruel to instill,<br />
A life of misery and despair,<br />
A life that no one should have to bear.</p>
<p>Society's expectations, traditions to uphold,<br />
But at what cost, their hearts sold?<br />
Chains of oppression, they're made to wear,<br />
Their freedom and choice, stripped bare.</p>
<p>Parents, guardians, don't you see,<br />
The damage that you're causing, can't you set them free?<br />
Marriage should be a bond of love and trust,<br />
Not a means to satisfy society's unjust.</p>
<p>Let their hearts and minds be free,<br />
Let them choose their own destiny,<br />
Forced marriages, a tragedy in disguise,<br />
Let's break these chains, and let them rise.</p>
<p>Let them bloom and grow with love,<br />
Let their hearts soar and reach above,<br />
For in their happiness lies our own,<br />
Let's break these chains, and let love be known.</p>
<p>Forced into marriages, they have no say<br />
Their lives become a game, a mere play<br />
Their future determined by the hands of another<br />
Their fate sealed, as if under a spell or a curse</p>
<p>To some, it may seem a cultural norm<br />
But for these girls, it's a life so forlorn<br />
Their dreams and aspirations forever lost<br />
As they become a possession, at a great cost</p>
<p>No longer able to live life on their own terms<br />
Their desires, their passions, all go unconfirmed<br />
Their voices silenced, their spirits broken<br />
Their hearts heavy, and their eyes a token</p>
<p>Of the pain that they carry deep inside<br />
As they continue to live in this forced ride<br />
Their emotions run high, but they cannot be expressed<br />
Their thoughts and opinions, forever repressed</p>
<p>Forced into a world, they didn't choose to belong<br />
Their future dictated, as if they don't belong<br />
Their lives reduced to mere commodities<br />
To be traded, bought, and sold like properties</p>
<p>Their bodies are a gift, but not theirs to give<br />
Their choices, their rights, taken away like a sieve<br />
Their worth, their value, reduced to a price<br />
Their dignity and self worth, taken without a fight</p>
<p>It's time for a change, for a world so new<br />
Where girls are respected, and their dreams come true<br />
Where they can decide, their own fate and destiny<br />
Where their voice is heard, and they can truly be free</p>
<p>Let's break this cycle, this age old tradition<br />
And let girls live a life with ambition<br />
Where they can thrive, and not just survive<br />
And be the best versions of themselves, so alive.</p>
<p>Let's empower them with knowledge and skill<br />
So that they can achieve what they truly will<br />
Let's support them, and give them a chance<br />
To shine bright and make their own stance</p>
<p>Forced marriages, a thing of the past<br />
Let's make a change, that will forever last<br />
Let's give these girls the gift of life<br />
And let them be the ones to decide.</p>
