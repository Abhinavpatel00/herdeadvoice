            <h1>The Unspoken Section Of Diary</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Innocent and pure, a child once bright,<br />
Now a victim of a heinous plight,<br />
Her father, brother, uncles, and kin,<br />
Subjecting her to sin upon sin.</p>
<p>Where once love and safety did reside,<br />
Now a darkness crept and did preside,<br />
A soul defiled, a heartbroken,<br />
By those who should have been a haven.</p>
<p>She wept and begged for mercy's grace,<br />
But found no succour in this place,<br />
For those who should have been her shield,<br />
Had turned upon her with savage zeal.</p>
<p>Her spirit shattered, her trust destroyed,<br />
Her life consumed by those who toyed,<br />
With her innocence, her very being,<br />
In acts that left her with no meaning.</p>
<p>The cruelty of these beasts so vile,<br />
Devoid of conscience, bereft of guile,<br />
What madness could possess such men,<br />
To inflict such pain on kin and kin.</p>
