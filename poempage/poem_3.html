            <h1>Unforgotten Whirlwinds of Heart</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>Our society accused her of bringing shame<br />
By snatching away her hopes and even name<br />
They treated her like an animal, not a girl<br />
Just to satisfy their barbaric thirst, biassed thinking which unfurls</p>
<p>The stigma surrounding sexual violence, won't let our heroine wear her
crown<br />
She's not alone in this battle, many are enduring the same frown</p>
<p>It demands a change from us all to stand and put a shield against such
crime<br />
And listen to stories of those who were affected with time<br />
It's time for no more oppression worn as a crown<br />
Time to lay down arm to prevent future destruction around</p>
