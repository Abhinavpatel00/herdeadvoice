            <h1>Not a Feminine light</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>She is not the representation of feminine grace</p>
<p>Whose cruel acts leave innocence in disgrace<br />
No sympathy we offer for her ill willed deeds<br />
As we stand with the purity that victim bleeds</p>
<p>Girls are not merely a word, a symbol to uphold<br />
When their innocence is sacred, we must staunchly uphold<br />
Where they are oppressed, we must rise to support<br />
Where they are exploited, we must strive to thwart</p>
<p>Those who aid in exploitation, they do not belong<br />
For feminine nature sings a different song<br />
Of compassion, kindness, and empathy in kind<br />
And to those who violate it, we leave them behind</p>
<p>We stand with the innocent, the pure and the true<br />
Their stories we hear, their cries we heed, we pursue<br />
And those who dare to cause them harm or pain<br />
We teach them a lesson, for they must not reign</p>
<p>The feminine soul is a light to behold<br />
And those who tarnish it, leave their own stories untold<br />
For in the end, only kindness and love remain<br />
And those who embody it, shall forever reign.</p>
