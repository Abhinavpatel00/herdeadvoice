            <h1>Battling the Tide of Fear</h1>
<h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
<p>With the weight of worries, anxiety grips her tight,<br />
Her heart aches and suffocates with fear, each night.<br />
Self-blame and shame flow through her veins in a flurry,<br />
And she struggles to keep her composure, in such a hurry.</p>
<p>It's hard for her to even breathe, to find some peace,<br />
But still she fights, her strength refusing to decrease.<br />
In the darkness of the night, she finds a calming pace,<br />
And the silence brings her comfort, in this lonely space.</p>
<p>She knows the journey ahead won't be an easy climb,<br />
But she refuses to give up, to let fear rule her time.<br />
She's a warrior, fighting to conquer her doubts,<br />
And with each step forward, she silences the shouts.</p>
<p>It's uneasy for her to put her undeserved pain in words,<br />
The hurt she feels is so obscure, like a flock of birds.<br />
Her soul cries out with deep and loud screams,<br />
As heart-wrenching memories haunt her in her dreams.</p>
<p>And so she holds it in, letting it simmer and stew,<br />
Until it spills over, leaving her feeling so blue.<br />
The tears of her started drying in her eyes,<br />
Leaving behind a heart with shallow beats and sighs.</p>
<p>The grey skies without rain symbolize her fear,<br />
So intense and limitless, it's hard to bear.<br />
Her soul can't seem to find faith and trust,<br />
And she wonders why she was left in this unjust.</p>
<p>They need to change and admit their mistakes,<br />
For her sake, for her heart's sake.<br />
In a sea of haunted thoughts and unbearable pain,<br />
Her childhood dreams and wishes all gone in vain.</p>
<p>The unavoidable self-blame and soul injury,<br />
Crushes her with each moment, suffocating her identity.<br />
She's in a heartbreaking state of mind,<br />
Where hope seems so hard to find.</p>
<p>Lost in the chaos and deep despair,<br />
She searches for a spark of strength to repair.<br />
Her heart beats with a heavy weight,<br />
As she struggles to keep her head up and fate.</p>
<p>She fights so hard against the tide of fear,<br />
To find a way out and persevere.<br />
To heal the wounds that run so deep,<br />
And awaken from each pain-induced sleep.</p>
<p>She knows it won't be easy to face her fears,<br />
But with each small step, she'll overcome the tears.<br />
She'll let go of the hurt and the past,<br />
And hold on to the love and light that will last.</p>
<p>In the depths of her soul, she fights the tide<br />
Of fear and pain that threaten to divide<br />
Her from the light that shines within her heart<br />
A flame that burns, steadfast and bright, impart</p>
<p>The strength and courage she needs to face<br />
The wounds that haunt her and leave no trace<br />
Of hope or joy, but still she rises<br />
Above the darkness, she perseveres and surprises</p>
<p>With each sleepless night, she faces her fears,<br />
And awakens to a world that's often unclear.</p>
