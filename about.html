                This book is dedicated to the girls and women whose voices have been silenced by sexual abuse and oppression. 
                <br><br>
                May this book serve as a testament to your strength, your resilience, and your unwavering spirit. 
                <br><br>
                To the society and the loved ones of those girls: she is suffering, she needs to be heard. Let her screams shout so loud that they tremble the monster's soul for such an act he did. Let her be the voice for herself and her sisters who suffered the same way in this world. Some still live with hearts full of injuries, and some found relief by dying with such intense pain.
                <br><br>
                We see you, we hear you, and we stand with you in solidarity.
                <br><br>
                May your stories ignite a flame of hope and spark a revolution of change.
