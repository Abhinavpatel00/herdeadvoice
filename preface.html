            <h1>Preface</h1>
            <p>
                I wrote this book for the teenagers and children who will shape the future of our world. Because, I know if the toxic mentality that we boys generate in childhood is replaced by kindness and condolence, then it may be hard for us to exploit someone when we get older. This book represents my heartfelt efforts to show the pain and suffering that we cause by dominating and exploiting someone.
                <br><br>
                If you are a girl and reading this book, then please gift this book to your father, brother, and friends or any men you know. If I could stop one abuse from happening, then it may be worth writing this book. By planting the seeds of kindness and condolence in their minds, we can help them build a better tomorrow, one that is free from the scourge of this heartbreaking abuse.
                <br><br>
                I have tried my best that readers of each age can find content heart-warming and add a new dimension to their thinking about the importance of consent and someone's tears.
                <br><br>
                I know, I cannot change society, this society is already broken and ruined, but by giving a message of kindness and mercy to youngsters and children, making them think through the eyes of compassion. They will make a better tomorrow. I hope my message goes to them.
                <br><br>
                I have tried to convey the true cost of abuse - the pain, the trauma, the shame, and the lifelong scars that it leaves behind. And I have also offered a message of hope - that by standing together and speaking out against abuse, we can make a difference, we can create a safer and more compassionate world for all and I know you will help me with it and I will fight till my last breath. 
                <br><br>
                Please join me in this fight to make our tomorrow better, our today.
